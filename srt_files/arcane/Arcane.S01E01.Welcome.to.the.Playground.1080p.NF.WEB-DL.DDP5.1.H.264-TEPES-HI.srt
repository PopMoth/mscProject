so I guess we're all disappointed.

359
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,083
You got us all wrong, my friend.

360
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,000
We were just... negotiating.

361
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,250
Now you're speaking my language.

362
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,541
How about you just give Huck
the rest of what you owe him,

363
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,750
and I'll let you walk out of here
in one piece?

364
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,583
Do we, uh... have a deal?

365
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:14,583
[exhales]

366
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:21,166
[coughs]
This is vile.

367
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,375
You'll learn to love it.

368
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,708
- [woman laughs]
- [indistinct chatter]

369
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,791
Welcome to the Lanes.

370
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,250
- [exhales]
- [Claggor groans]

371
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:36,875
[Mylo grunts]

372
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,708
Vander learns none of this.

373
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,583
[Mylo] No worries there.
Powder took care of the evidence.

374
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:45,666
I tried, okay? You don't get it.
You're older, you're bigger.

375
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,791
- It, it isn't fair.
- So stick with us!

376
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,375
Take a punch or two.

377
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,166
[crowd laughing in distance]

378
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,958
- [Vander] Everyone all right?
- [Mylo] Never better.

379
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,041
Good.

380
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,958
I don't suppose you can explain why it is
that I'm hearing about an explosion

381
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,500
and a foot chase topside?

382
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,583
Four children fleeing the scene.

383
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,041
What the hell were you thinking?

384
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,916
That we can handle a real job.

385
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,291
A real job?

386
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,309
We got our own tip, planned a route,
nobody even saw.

387
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,416
- You blew up a building.
- That wasn't...

388
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,250
Did you even stop to think about
what could have happened to you?

389
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,041
Eh? To them?

390
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,208
[sighs]

391
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,916
Where did you even get this tip?

392
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:37,708
- We just heard it at Benzo's shop.
- From?

393
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,791
- Little Man.
- [sighs heavily]

394
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:44,375
I took us there.
If you wanna be mad, be mad at me.

395
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:47,418
But you're the one who always says
we have to earn our place in this world.

396
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,500
I also told you time and time again,
the Northside's off-limits.

397
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,416
- We stay out of Piltover's business.
- Why?

398
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,583
They've got plenty, while we're down here
scraping together coins.

399
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,208
When did you get so comfortable
living in someone else's shadow?

400
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,250
Everyone out.

401
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,750
[door opens]

402
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:14,708
Sit down.

403
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:17,958
- I'm fine.
- [Vander] Sit. Down.

404
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,041
[sighs]

405
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,166
[exhales]

406
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,375
Those kids look up to you.

407
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:29,791
Yeah, I know.
[sighs]

408
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,791
You know, but you don't know.

409
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,166
When people look up to you,
you don't get to be selfish.

410
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,375
- I'm not...
- You say run, they run.

411
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:37,958
You say swim, they dive in.

412
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,375
You say light a fire,
they show up with oil.

413
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,208
But whatever happens, it's on you.

414
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,166
[sighs]

415
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:49,500
Just like it's on me
what happens to us down here.

416
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:54,291
We make ourselves a problem for Piltover,
and they will send the enforcers.

417
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:56,458
So? Why answer to them?

418
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:59,041
These are our streets.
Someone should remind them of that.

419
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,458
You're not hearing me. That path?

420
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
This?

421
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,583
It's not gonna solve your problems.

422
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,666
Just makes more of them.

423
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,458
We clear?

424
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:12,666
[spits]

425
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,708
- [Vander exhales]
- [groans]

426
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,333
- How'd you get this?
- [scoffs]

427
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,458
Some idiot was following us.

428
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,208
On our side? Who?

429
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,541
I don't know. He was after the stuff.

430
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:27,750
Where is it now?

431
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:31,333
[sighs]
We lost it.

432
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,625
All of it?

433
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,750
Good.

434
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,541
Nothing can tie you
to what happened up there.

435
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,083
You're gonna have to lay low
for a bit, understand?

436
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,041
Okay.

437
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,041
We're gonna be fine, right?

438
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,791
I'll take care of it.

439
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:01,375
Oh, you did put that idiot
on his ass, though, right?

440
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:02,958
Mm.

441
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,291
[chuckles]

442
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,375
[footsteps approaching]

443
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:12,250
[Mylo hums]

444
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,541
Get up, Claggor. We're going out.

445
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,625
Wait, now?
[huffs]

446
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,208
Hey, hey, that's mine!

447
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:22,833
- You wanna be treated like adults, right?
- [Claggor grunts]

448
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,500
Then you should know better than
to come back from a job empty-handed.

449
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,906
[Vander] I'm gonna have a little word
with your informant.

450
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:35,583
All right, give me the details
of exactly what happened up there.

451
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
[grunts]

452
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,791
[suspenseful music]

453
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:55,708
[Mylo] She's a problem.

454
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,070
[Vi sighs]
Mylo, I'm really not...

455
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,916
[Mylo] Do you remember
what was in that bag?

456
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,875
The biggest payout
we've ever seen and she just lost it.

457
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,458
She made a mistake.

458
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,375
Name one time she hasn't.

459
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,833
- [Vi] She's young.
- [Mylo] Don't bullshit me.

460
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,833
You were twice the person at half her age.

461
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:13,125
You know what, Mylo? You're right.

462
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,791
There's a bunch of things Powder
just can't do.

463
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,875
- [Mylo] You don't have to tell me twice.
- [bangs]

464
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,250
- Like, complain about everything.
- What?

465
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,166
- And brag nonstop.
- Okay, okay, I see where this is going.

466
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,791
[Vi] Pick fights with the group
when we need to focus.

467
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:28,708
[chuckling]
Vi, I...

468
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,708
And tell strangers on the street
that we got a nice haul?

469
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:34,416
- I, I didn't mean to...
- Powder's my problem, okay?

470
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,300
Your problem is never knowing
when to shut up.

471
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,541
But I'm gonna help you with that. Ready?

472
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,083
You see this look on my face?

473
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,750
This will always mean
it's time to shut up.

474
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,416
But... I...

475
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,000
[groans]

476
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:49,000
[background chatter]

477
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,000
Nobody comes in.

478
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:58,416
We're closed.

479
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,083
Well, open up.

480
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,458
For good. You can take
your worthless junk elsewhere.

481
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,291
[groans]
Just as well.

482
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,916
Owner's the shittiest businessman I know.

483
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,000
[both laugh]

484
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,125
- Ekko. What's going on with that thing?
- [grunts]

485
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,916
Give me a few seconds.
The cannon pinion's still busted.

486
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,416
Finish it later. Vander and I need a word.

487
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,291
- But...
- [Benzo] Uh-uh. Off you go.

488
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,708
[metal clanks]

489
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:24,916
[Ekko grunts]

490
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,123
- [Ekko] Claggor.
- [Claggor] He-he-hey, Little Man.

491
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:31,666
You're a little early.

492
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,875
My guys are still roundin' up
this month's collections.

493
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:37,250
Won't have numbers until next, um...

494
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,041
[Benzo] Whoo.

495
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,083
Why are you muckin' about with this?

496
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,041
I assume you've heard.

497
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,041
Yeah, me and half the undercity.

498
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:49,833
[sighs]
How could they be so stupid?

499
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,375
The younger folk think
it's the right thing to do.

500
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,291
[Vander] Yeah, and Vi's one of them.

501
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,250
Throws herself at trouble
wherever she can find some.

502
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,333
Eh, they're growing up, Vander.

503
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,708
Looking to write their own stories.
You can't protect them forever.

504
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:04,833
[sighs]

505
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:06,500
Someone was following them.

506
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:10,041
- Whole lot of someones, from what I heard.
- Not enforcers.

507
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,750
- Someone on our side.
- Who?

508
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:17,250
There's worse things
than enforcers out there.

509
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,833
We both know that.

510
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,458
Yeah, I was hopin' you'd be working today.

511
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,333
- Did you guys go?
- Sure did.

512
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:28,125
Hey, listen, how did you find that place?

513
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,708
- I just...
- Whoa, did you fight the enforcers?

514
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,583
What? Oh, no. Eh, just some bums.

515
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,625
Oh, did Vi kick their asses?

516
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,666
Yeah, I mean,
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

517
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,708
Oh, she showed me
a couple moves to practice. Look.

518
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:42,333
[Ekko grunting]

519
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:44,458
- Yeah, it's... it's coming along.
- Ya!

520
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,541
Hey, so, how'd you find
that place, anyway?

521
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,833
Uh, this weirdo came into the shop.

522
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,791
Bought a whole bunch of stuff
Benzo only keeps there for display.

523
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,125
He paid in gold and didn't even haggle.

524
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,000
I charged him double price. Sucker.

525
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,500
- But how did you know where he lived?
- Uh, followed him.

526
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,666
- How else?
- Oh. Right.

527
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,916
[Claggor] Oh, crap.

528

00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,125

- They'll be fine. Go.

530
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, hello.

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,520
- [Benzo] Evening, friends.
- [hissing]

535
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:31,833
[whispers]
Shit.

536
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,208
[sighs]

537
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,791
Something I can help you with?

538
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:41,500
Some trencher trash attacked one
of the buildings in the Academy district,

539
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,083
but you already knew that.

540
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,125
We're looking for the culprits.

541
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,208
Got a description?

542
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:50,166
Yeah, it's exactly who you're picturing
in that thick head of yours.

543
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,416
Mm. You think my head is thick?

544
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,583
Uh, just past the average.

545
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,958
Listen, you shady son of a...

546
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,791
[enforcer] How about you go
for a little walk, Marcus?

547
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,375
Cool off a bit.

548
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,541
Go.

549
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,083

550

[rat squeaks]

554
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,733
[Benzo] Lovely chap you've brought.

555
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:35,916
[indistinct chatter]

556
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:39,616
[enforcer] Don't mind the kid.

557
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,666
Doesn't know when to pipe down.

558
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,250
[Vander] Some things are the same
topside and bottom.

559
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,125
You know this crossed a line upstairs.

560
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,416
Was anyone hurt?

561
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,416
A building was blown to bits.
What do you think?

562
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,416
[sighs]

563
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,541
Those who did this will be dealt with.

564
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,291
That workshop belonged to the Kirammans.

565
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,125
You know what kind of stuff
they had in there?

566
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,250
Makes this place look like a candy shop.

567
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,750
The Council needs someone
to make an example of.

568
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,583
People need to feel safe.

569
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,416
Yeah, topside people.

570
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,291
[enforcer] We had a deal, Vander.

571
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:22,375
You keep your people off my streets,
and I stay out of your business.

572
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,875
Give me a name. We'll do things quiet.

573
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,958
No one will know you were involved.

574
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,500
I can't do that.

575
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,791
You don't seem to grasp
how serious this is.

576
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:36,250
If I don't put someone
behind bars tonight,

577
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:40,375
the next time I come down here,
I'll have an army of enforcers with me.

578
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,583
We both know how that'll go.

579
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:46,583
I'm sorry, Grayson,
but I can't offer up my own people.

580
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:51,916
[exhales]

581
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,208
If you change your mind,
this will reach me.

582
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:57,833
[Grayson] And only me.

583
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,833

589
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,625
What are you calling this one?

590
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,500
[Powder] Whisker.

591
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,666
- You wanna talk about today?
- What's the point?

592
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,958
I ruined everything. I always do.

593
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,333
Nobody said that.

594
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:43,416
No. Just that you were
"twice the person" at half my age.

595
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,083
You heard them.

596
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,083
I'm not a fighter.

597
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,500
You don't have to be.

598
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:54,916
Look, I've got these and you've got those.

599
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,583
They never work.

600
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
They will.

601
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,416
- Come with me.
- What?

602
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,208
[Vi] Come on.

603
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,625
[background chatter]

604
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,625
What are we doing here?

605
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,833
See that gutter running along the canal?

606
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:34,041
[Vi] That's where Claggor got his foot
stuck running from enforcers.

607
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:38,125
They thought it was funny,
so they left him there.

608
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,125
He was out all night before we found him.

609
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,583
That sign?

610
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,208
- [Vi] You see it?
- [Powder] Uh-huh.

611
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,666
Mylo tripped over his own paint bucket

612
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,458
and nearly fell off trying to draw
a giant middle finger.

613
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:58,166
- [Vi] His ass made that splotch.
- [Powder laughs]

614
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,375
And that?

615
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:03,875
[Vi sighs]

616
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:07,875
When I was a kid, some guy took
my favorite toy and threw it up there.

617
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,458
I used to come out here at night
and stare at it,

618
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:17,375
hoping maybe the wind
or a bird might knock it down.

619
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,625
We've all had bad days.

620
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:27,083
But we learn. And we stick together.

621
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,291
Oh, I forgot.

622
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,541
These were in my pocket.

623
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,958
- They're from the apartment.
- What are they?

624
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:40,958
I don't know.

625
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,083
- Should we show Vander?
- No.

Let's keep this our little secret.

628
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:56,000
Mylo's wrong, Powder.
You're stronger than you think.

629
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,333
And one day...

630
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,541
this city's gonna respect us.

631

637

[man 1] You were supposed to follow them
and not interfere.

638
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,708
[grunting]
I'm sorry.

639
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,208
[Deckard] They just caught us by surprise.

640
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:48,416
[man 1] Now his accomplice
is asking questions about you.

641

That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

the explosion in the upper city.

[man 1] That was them?

645
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:05,416
[Deckard] Yeah. The topsiders
are up in arms looking for 'em.

646
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,625
[man 1] Vander's in trouble.
