[wheezes]

181
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,041
[rasps]

182
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,083
[Finn gasping]

183
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,083
[shudders]

184
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,833
I would have had your son killed for this.

185
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,583
Though I suppose we're ahead
on that account.

186
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,416
- Get out.
- [whimpers]

187
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,708
[door opens, closes]

188
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,875
[Silco] Were you tempted?

189
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,500
Not for a worm like him.

190
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,791
[Sevika] But he won't be the last.

191
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,750
[puffs]

192
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,625
[ominous music]

193
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,250
Hmm.

194
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,916
[birds chirping]

195
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,375
[footsteps]

[dark music]

197
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,000
[Silco] Perfect place for an ambush.

198
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,625
And you without your hammer.

199
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,125
I was reminded recently of what
brought us together in the first place.

200
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,583
The threats beyond our walls.

201
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,291
This city has a short memory.

202
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,958
"Progress."

203
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,833
Far be it from me to stand in the way.

204
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,875
[dramatic music]

205
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,625
[Silco scoffs]

206
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,666
"Free trade routes, blanket amnesty,

207
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,458
unrestricted access
to the Hexgates, sovereignty."

208
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,458
Do you really think you're in a position
to demand all this?

209
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,458
I give you credit for your stunt, boy.

210
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,500
Didn't think you had the stomach.

211
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,708
But the big display
followed by a request for parley,

212
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,041
you're tipping your hand.

213
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,083
You're afraid.

214
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:04,916
I am afraid.

215
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,375
Today, I got a glimpse
of what war between us might look like.

216
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,708
Your people wouldn't stand a chance.

217
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,791
The Council couldn't care less.

218
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,625
I'm trying to save you from annihilation.

219
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,250
Well, well.

220
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,083
Not the fresh-faced Academy pledge,
are you?

221
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,000
You want peace, this is the price.

222
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,916
[sighs]

223
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,916
You'll discontinue
the production of Shimmer?

224
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,083
Half there already.

225
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,791
Return the Gemstone.

226
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,500
And I need Jinx.

227
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,833
She has to pay for what she's done.

228
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,958
They weren't her crimes.
She was working for me.

229
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:49,583
Believe me, if I had it my way,
it'd be you rotting in Stillwater,

230
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,416
but we can't make a deal
with a snake and cut off its head.

231
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,083
We both have our shitty parts to play.

232
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,666
Get me Jinx.
And I'll give you your nation of Zaun.

233
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,875

239
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,000
[Heimerdinger] Astonishing.

240
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,583
You say all this came about
in your own brief lifespan?

241
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,791
How were you able to accomplish
so much so quickly?

242
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,125
You'd be surprised what you can pull off
when your life depends on it.

243
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,416
- [bone cracks]
- [gasps, grunts]

244
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,958
Uh, why this form?

245
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,000
Surely, there are more efficient
and safer methods of transportation.

00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,416
- [cheering continues]
- [Heimerdinger] Oh.

252
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,020
[Ekko] It's not enough to give people
what they need to survive,

253
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,750
you have to give them
what they need to live.

254
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,708
[cheering continues]

255
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,500
A thousand times
I've imagined this moment.

256
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,291
Never like this.

257
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,083
[Silco] All we ever wanted.

258
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,791
The boy didn't even haggle.

259
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,708
And what do I lose but problems?

260
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,041
Oh, it all makes sense now, brother.

I wish I could say it gets easier, kiddo.

307
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,208
But I'd be lying.

308
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,583
What I can say is...

309
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,625
She still needs you.

310
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,250
They all do.

[Jayce] <i>Councilors...</i>

336
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,291
My recent unsanctioned activities

337
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,750
in the underground
have shown me two things.

338
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,250
I'm not fit to govern the people
who live there.

339
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,208
And neither are you.

340
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,416
Our opportunity
to demonstrate our compassion,

341
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,166
our dedication,

342
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,416
our solidarity has passed.

343
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,000
They're right not to trust us.

344
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,875
You're walking a fine line, Jayce.

345
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:36,625
With respect, I don't give a shit
what any of you think of me anymore.

346
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,666
Except you.

347
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,541
You were right.

348
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,250
You were always right.

349
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,208
My days here are numbered,
but I've come with Viktor,

350
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:52,500
my partner and a Zaunite,
with one final proposal.

351
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:58,000
Jayce has brokered a peace with Silco.

352
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,833
In exchange for the undercity's
independence.

353
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,541
What? Nonsense! We have procedures...

00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,625
But I should have known better.

363
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,875
Powder?

364
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,916
[Jinx] Nothing ever stays dead.

365
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:57,541
- [gasps]
- [metal clanging]

366
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:58,916
Are we alone?

367
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,916
- [Jinx] For now.
- [gasps]

368
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,333
[Jinx] Maybe forever.

369
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,916
Wanna know a secret?

370
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,375
Silco thinks he made Jinx,

371
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:17,041
with all his rants
and his hard-won lessons.

372
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,958
"Excise your doubts, Jinx."

373
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,833
"Be what they fear, Jinx."

374
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:26,083
Like everything was the same
as when Vander left him.

375
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:29,708
But he didn't make Jinx.

376
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,333
You did.

377
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,166
I'm sorry, Powder.

378
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,791
I never meant to leave you.

379
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,125
[Jinx] You never left.

380
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,791
I always heard you.

381
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,458
Shadows in the streets,
prickles on the back of my neck.

382
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,708
Your voice.

383
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,041
Pushing me.

384
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:57,250
Picking me up
when all the colors were black.

385
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,541
You're the reason I'm still alive.

386
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:04,375
I spent so many nights
in that shitty prison.

387
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:08,458
On the freezing floor,
hungry, bloody, counting the hours.

388
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,291
The only thing...

389
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:15,291
The only thing that kept me going
was the thought of getting back to you.

390
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,833
[Jinx] Are we still sisters?

391
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,333
[Vi] Nothing is ever going to change that.

392
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:30,750
[sudden music sting]

393
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:34,750
- I always knew you'd come back.
- What's going on?

394
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:40,333
[foreboding music]

395

[wind whirs]

396
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:53,125
- No.
- [Jinx] He took everything from us.

397
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,375
Right here, he stabbed Vander in the back.

398
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,166
Just like he planned to do with me.

399
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,083
[crow squawks]

400
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,916
[Jinx] <i>All the time saying
you abandoned me when he knew the truth.</i>

401
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,333
[Silco mumbles]

402
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,541
Liar.

403
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:12,041
Mm. We're missing someone.

404
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,291

[blows]

408
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:37,833
Huh?

409
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,333
I paid your girlfriend
a visit this morning.

410
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,958
[gasps]
What did you do?

411
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,000
- I made her a snack.
- Huh?

412
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,208
[shaky breathing]

413
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,250
No!
[gasps]

414
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,541
- [pants]
- [Jinx] Sheesh.

415
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,375
I'm not that crazy.

416
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,875
[metal clanks]

417
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:16,041
Powder! Leave her out of this.

00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,166
[Caitlyn breathing shakily]

420
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,583
- [Jinx] Now...
- [Caitlyn whimpers]

421
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,458
Where should I sit?

422
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,916
That's your choice, really.

423
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,541
Make her go away. Please.

424
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,583
- Send her on her way and...
- [Caitlyn grunts]

425
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,916
And you can have Powder back.

426
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,125
Mm.

427
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,750
[stutters]

428
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,666
- I can't.
- Ah.

429
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,916
No! Powder, listen.

430
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,375
We... we can just go.

431
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,708
- We'll leave and never come back.
- [gasps]

432
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,375
Where would we go?

433
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:08,666
No, no, no. She's not saying that.

434
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
It's true, we'll put this behind us.

435
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,226
You'll never have
to see him again, Powder.

436
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,083
[mumbles]

437
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,041
What do you have to say about that?

438
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,708
Her name is Jinx!

439
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,041
She's lying.

440
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,250
You'll be with her a day
before she realizes

441
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,333
you aren't that girl anymore
and turns her back on you.

442
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:31,416
Mm-hmm.

443
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,166
You aren't lying?

444
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,000
[Jinx] You wouldn't lie to me. Not again.

445
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,166
I'm not lying.

446
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,541
I'm on your side. I promise.

447
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:50,500
Shut up! We're talking!

448
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,875
The topsiders offered me everything.

449
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,583
[Silco] Independence, a seat at the table.

450
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,708
All in return for you.

451
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,708
They can all burn.

452
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:04,125
Everyone betrays us, Jinx. Vander. Her.

453
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,291
They will never understand.

454
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,458
It's only us.

455
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,208
You're my daughter.

456
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,750
