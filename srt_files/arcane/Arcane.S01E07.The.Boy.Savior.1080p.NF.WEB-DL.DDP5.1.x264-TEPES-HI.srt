00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,041
She was there for me! Not the enforcer.

178
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,750
[Mylo] <i>Remember her name?</i>

179
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,333
Why would I remember her name?
[grunts]

180
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,333
[growls]

181
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,333
[breathes rapidly]

182
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,458
Well, she's just some stupid topsider!

183
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,791
- [pierces]
- [groans]

184
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,583
[grunting]

185
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,083
[chuckles nervously]

186
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,750
[grumbles]

187
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,291
[panting]

188
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,333
Caitlyn.

189
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,708
[inhales, cackles]

190
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,500
[laughs]

191
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,791
[pants]

192
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,833
[ominous music]

193
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,416
[bug chirping]

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,833
[suspenseful music]

195
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:57,916
Pow.

196
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,875
[kids chattering, laughing]

197
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,333
[tranquil music]

198
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,333
[kid 1] Come on. Go!

199
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,666
[kid 2] I got it.

200
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,333
Whoo-hoo!

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,625
[Vi] Is that real tree?

202
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,958
[Ekko] Pretty cool, huh?

203
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,541
When I first saw it,
I knew this was the place.

204
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,125
If a single seed could make it down here,
so could we.

205
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,208
[Vi] You built all this?

206
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,750
[Ekko] Not alone.

207
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,916
- After Vander...
- [boy laughs]

208
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,416
...died,

209
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,958
Silco flooded the lanes with Shimmer.

210
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,500
[Ekko] He didn't care
what it did to people.

211
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,041
Everyone here was an addict or a victim.

212
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,333
Hi.

213
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,336
[Ekko] They needed
somewhere safe to start again.

214
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,000
[children chatter]

215
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,666
I should have been there.
For you. For everyone.

216
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,250
That's a good way to drive yourself crazy.

217
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,458
[Ekko] If I just went with you that day,
maybe none of this would have happened.

218
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,791
Or maybe you'd be dead. Or... changed.

219
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,666
Powder's gone, Vi.

220
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,708
All that's left is Jinx
and she belongs to Silco.

221
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,291
You're wrong. She's still in there.
I can reach her.

222
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,416
You can't.

223
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,166
[sighs]

224
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,833
I know my sister.

225
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,875
I got one more thing to show you.

226
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:23,208
[mysterious music]

227
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,291
[mysterious music continues]

228
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,875
[Ekko] This is everyone we've lost.

229
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,541
The price of our freedom.

230
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,833
Some of it was Enforcers.

231
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,000
[Ekko] Most was Silco.

232
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:47,083
Your sister works for him not because
she has to, but because she wants to.

233
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,666
I'm sorry, but that's who she is now.

234
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,375
[breathes deeply]

235
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,625
[indistinct shouting]

236
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,875
[Enforcer 1] Get down!

237
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,038
- [protester] Let us through!
- [Enforcer 1] Come on!

238
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,791
[coughs]

239
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,291
- [distant shouting]
- [sniffs, exhales]

240
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,625
[Enforcer 1] We understand.

241
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,958
Just stand down!

242
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,142
[distant shouting continues]

243
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,208
- Thank you for alerting me, Sheriff.
- [Marcus] Not a problem, Councilor.

244
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,416
Jayce, what is this?

245
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
[background clamoring]

246
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,541
Do you have any idea how this looks?

247
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,125
I order a blockade
and my own partner violates it?

248
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,541
You ordered this? Why?

249
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,708
There are people down there
who seem hell-bent on destroying us.

250
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,875
What were you doing?

251
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,250
I was consulting a friend
about our quandary.

252
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,041
I told you, I knew someone.

253
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,208
Well, you didn't say
they were from the undercity.

254
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,958
[Viktor] What difference does that make?

255
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,250
What diff... They're dangerous.

256
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,083
I'm from the undercity.

257
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,791
[Jayce] You're right.

258
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,333
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,625
I've had a lot on my plate.

260
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,000
Was your friend able to help?

261
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,625
No.

262
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,625
No, he said, "Nature was resistant
to this sort of tampering."

263
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,041
All right, we'll keep at it.

264
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,885
- [indistinct shouting]
- [Enforcer 2 grunts]

265
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,791
- [explosion]
- [all clamoring]

266
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,833
[indistinct shouting continues]

267
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,416
[foreboding music]

268
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,958
[Finn] First, this wild attack
in the heart of Piltover.

269
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,958
Now, the border's closing.

270
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,208
We're bleeding money and for what?

271
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:48,083
His dreams of rebellion?
He's losing control.

272
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,416
If we stand together...

273
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,416
[Silco] We aren't due for an assembly.

274
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:56,958
[door closes]

275
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,541
We should be.

276
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,583
Ever since your stunt topside,
profits have been plummeting.

277
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,625
He's right.
Merchandise is frozen at the border.

278
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,833
Topsiders are too afraid to cross.

279
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,791
We're all wondering,
what's your plan to fix this?

280
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,333
You're all wondering, are you?

281
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:22,500
Way I see it, we should cut a deal
and give back the Gemstone.

282
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,750
[Finn] Better to have some trade
than none at all.

283
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,083
The border issue is temporary.
Jinx will deal with it.

284
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,958
Huh.
[laughs]

285
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,041
Rumor is, your dog's off her leash.

286
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,958
How you meant to bring Piltover to heel
if you can't handle your own people, huh?

287
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,458
[hissing]

288
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:50,291
[raspy breathing]

289
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,291
- [man coughing]
- [hissing continues]

290
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,583
What's that?

291
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,541
[both coughing]

292
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,583
Oh, you don't recognize it?

293
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,791
[all coughing]

294
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,875
[Silco] Have you forgotten
where we came from?

295
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,541
The mines they had us in?

296
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,208
- Air so thick it clogged your throat.
- [coughing continues]

297
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,791
- Stuck in your eyes.
- [gasps]

298
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,708
[both coughing]

299
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,000
[Silco] But I pulled you all up
from the depths.

300
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,500
- [coughing]
- Offered you a taste of topside.

301
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,791
And fresh air.

302
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,333
[coughing]

303
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,666
I gave you life.

304
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,500
Purpose.

305
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,375
[coughing]

306
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,916
But you've grown fat and complacent.

307
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,958
Too much time in the sun.

308
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,708
[coughing continues]

309
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:52,833
[coughing continues loudly]

310
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,833
[grunts, gags]

311
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:55,750
[chokes]

312
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:00,833
We came from a world where there
was never enough to go around, Finn.

313
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,833
[wheezes]

314
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,000
That is why we fight.

315
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,791
Do you remember?

316
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,041
[gags]

317
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,958
[whimpers]
Sorry. Please.

318
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,333
[choking]
Please.

319
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,625
[inhales deeply]

320
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,458
[grunts, inhales sharply]

321
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,833
Don't forget again.

322
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,500
[Finn panting]

323
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,000
[creaks, whirs]

324
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,250
[all groaning, coughing]

325
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,375
[Silco] Good meeting.

326
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,791
[coughing continues]

327
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,250
[chiming]

328
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:51,958
[whooshes]

[breathes deeply]

331
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,250
[dramatic music]

332
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,958
[Elora] I've had word from
our friends overseas.

333
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,250
This threat from the undercity
is drawing attention.

334
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,500
[sighs]

335
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Piltover looks vulnerable.

336
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,083
[exhales]

337
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,500
It's too soon. Jayce isn't ready.

338
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,583
[distant rumbling]

339
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,625
There's one other thing.

340
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,625
This arrived for you.

341
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,500
[gasps]

342
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,250
[ominous music]

343
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,083
[door creaks open]

344
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,416
[Caitlyn breathing heavily]

345
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,375
[chain clanks]

346
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,083
[Caitlyn grunts]

347
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,041
- Hmm?
- [Caitlyn stutters]

348
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,166
[pants, grunts]

349
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,041
[scoffs]

350
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,791
What have you done with Vi?

351
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,458
[boy clears throat]

352
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:16,750
Listen, let her go. I brought her here.
It's me you want.

353
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,125
[gasps]

354
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,000
- My hero.
- You're...

355
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,875
But I thought you...
I thought they were hurting you!

356
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,833
Vi tells me I can trust you.

357
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,125
[Ekko] You get
a pass back topside, that's it.

358
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,291
Let's go.

359
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,625
[sighs]

360
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,208
[exhales]

361
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,541
[Jinx] Let me help you with that.

362
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,250
[grunts]

363
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,750
Where've you been, Jinx?

364
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:54,541
Oh, you know.
Here, there, chasing down dead ends.

365
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:58,916
And guess what? They're not all dead.

366
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,333
I can explain.

367
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,750
- [groans]
- Don't move, silly. I might hurt you.

368
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:09,875
I didn't know. Marcus never told me
she was in Stillwater.

369
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,791
- [grumbles]
- But you found out she came back.

370
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,458
- You lied.
- [pierces]

371
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,916
[Silco grunts]

372
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,708
- I wanted to protect you.
- From what?

373
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:25,000
She and the enforcer are back
for the crystal. Not for you.

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,875
- [exhales]
- Have you forgotten how she left you?

375
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:33,625
Who found you? Who cared for you?
Gave you a home?

376
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:39,083
I am your family.
Everyone else betrays us.

377
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,041
- [Jinx whimpers]
- [Silco] I need you.

378
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,916
- [Jinx sobs]
- [Silco] Now more than ever.

379
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,333
You have to complete the weapon.

380
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,333
[sobs]

381
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,500
- [clicks]
- [groans]

382
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,041
[panting]

383
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,708
[grumbles]

384
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,916
[heavy breathing]

385
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,291
- [background chatter]
- [birds chirping]

386
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,250
It's beautiful.

387
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,583
If your people had your way,
it'd be rubble and ash.

388
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,291
It's a misunderstanding.

389
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,666
They think you work for Silco.

390
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,750
Your people hunt us like animals.
Silco pays them to do it.

391
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,041
That's not possible. You're wrong.

392
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,250
Say that one more time.

393
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,750
Ekko, she believes what she's saying,
okay? She's not your enemy.

394
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,000
[scoffs]
Oh, yeah? Then what's this?

395
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,333
[object trills]

396
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,333
You got it.
You have to let me take that back.

397
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,750
- [sighs]
- What is it?

398
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,041
It's a Gemstone.

399
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,666
It was stolen during the attack.
By your sister.

400
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,958
You just forgot to mention that?

401
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,375
With this, someone
with the right knowledge could build...

402
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,750
any Hextech device.

403
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:07,291
If enforcers are becoming
more... aggressive, that's why.

404
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,750
We could beat Silco with this.

405
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,833
That won't solve things.

406
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,583
Easy for you to say. Your people
aren't dying all around you.

407
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,000
Ekko, it's wrong what's been done to you.

408
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,500
[Caitlyn] You'd be well
within your rights to keep it.

409
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,416
I couldn't blame you.

410
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,208
But... if you do,

411
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,625
this cycle of violence will never stop.

412
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,000
This is our best shot
at setting the record straight.

413
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,291
This city needs healing.

414
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,791
More than I ever realized.

415
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,791
Please, let me help you.

416
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:48,958
You got a plan?

417
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,500
I have a friend on the council.

418
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,000
Let me take the Gemstone to him.

419
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,000
[Caitlyn] He'll listen to me.
Your people wouldn't have to hide anymore.

420
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:04,208
One condition.
I'm the one who gives it to them.

421
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,125
Um, the form is crude, but...

422
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,833
uh, the engineering is... inspired.

423
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,416
You think they could crack Hextech?

424
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,708
Mm. It's a leap.

425
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:24,125
It's been suggested that they may
have found a way to utilize the Gemstone.

426
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:28,458
If we are to assume the worst, that would
mean they've turned it into a weapon.

427
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,458
Well, do we know this for certain?

428
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,833
We can't afford to wait to find out.

429
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,000
Wait. What are you suggesting?

430
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,708
We should prepare our own countermeasures.

431
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,000
You want us to build weapons?

432
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:47,041
Absolutely not.
That is not why we invented Hextech.

433
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,625
[Jayce] We would shatter
any attempt at peace.

434
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,184
- Heimerdinger would never go for this.
- Heimerdingers' inaction

435
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,625
is what brought us here.
You said so yourself.

436
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,875
The peace is already broken, Jayce.

437
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,416
I'm only asking you to prepare
to defend your people.

438
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,291
[Mel] If we're lucky,
we'll never need to use it.

439
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,500
[scoffs, sighs]

440
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,208
The decision is yours.

441
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:12,625
[scoffs]

442
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:13,958
[sighs]

443
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,583
[sighs]

444
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,791
[Viktor] Ridiculous.
You cannot be considering this.

445
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,833
What if she's right? Are we just
gonna stand by while they attack us?

446
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,500
We're scientists, not soldiers.

447
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,250
We have the knowledge to defend ourselves.

448
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,666
We agreed Hextech was to improve lives...

449
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,083
[stammers]
...not to take them.

450
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,583
We may not have a choice.

451
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,333
- [ticking]
- [both gasp]

452
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,916

[sighs]

455
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,083
There is always a choice.

456
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:00,833
I need to think.

457
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,875

[trills]

464
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,250
What are they?

465
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:02,250
We call them firelights.
Never seen so many though.

466
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,958
[trilling]

467
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:09,166

[Mrs. Talis exhales]

00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,375
I'm worried I have to do something
I never thought I would.

Vi?

486
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,625
I can't leave her again.

487
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,291
You can't change her.

488
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,916
I have to try.

489
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,791
[Ekko scoffs]

490
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:19,041
Don't get yourself killed.

[Vi chuckles]

492
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,041
No promises.

[foreboding music continues]

494
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,125
[Vi] It's been real, Cupcake.
Thanks. For everything.

[grunts]

496
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:46,208
- [Mylo laughs]
- Shut up. It's just a goodbye hug.

497
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:50,458
She wouldn't do that. Not again.

What the hell is this?

502
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:26,583
Sir! I have proof.
Silco's behind everything.

503
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:33,833
[Marcus] Show me.

504
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:38,958

No.

Hmm.

00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,583
