[Viktor] A mechanical arm,
equipped with a powerful ray of light.

[zapping]

186
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,583
Imagine what our artificers could do
with such a device.

187
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,500
I want Hextech to be a tool
for us to build a new world.

188
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,833
- And now, it's finally possible.
- [whimpers]

189
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,166
Anyway, this is our presentation.

190
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,541
Quite amazing, gentlemen.
You should be very proud.

191
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:55,333
Obviously, there are a few kinks
to iron out and screws to be tightened,

192
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,416
but give it a decade of careful research,
and it will be ready.

193
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,666
A decade?

194
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,666
Oh, don't worry, my boy.
It zips past you in the blink of an eye.

195
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,541
With respect, Professor.

196
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,541
We can be improving lives
with Hextech now.

197
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,250
A breakthrough like this
takes time, Viktor.

198
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,416
Putting that kind of power
into everyone's hands is dangerous.

199
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,958
Keep at it and I'm sure
you will discover a way

200
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,791
to safeguard Hextech against misuse.

00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,875
You're from the undercity.

213
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,833
I didn't do anything. She's crazy.

214
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,041
- [grunts]
- Easy.

215
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,333
She shot me.

216
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,875
Who shot you? Who were you working for?

217
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,583
- I can't. He'll kill me.
- Who?

218
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,291
- [groans]
- [Caitlyn] I can protect you.

219
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,083
[Marcus] Caitlyn Kiramman,
why does that not surprise me?

220
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,000
Interfering in an investigation, again.

221
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,125
You're supposed to be guarding
your mother's tent.

222
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:28,041
I was, Sheriff, but she doesn't need it.
And clearly, this takes priority.

223
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,333
I realize you're used
to getting your way, Kiramman,

224
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,291
but we have a chain of command
for a reason.

225
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,958
[Caitlyn] I understand.

226
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,666
But there's more going on here
than just the smuggling.

227
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,750
- If I could just question him I could...
- [Marcus] I'll take it from here.

228
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,309
Since you're looking for more work,

229
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,666
you can take the graveyard shift tonight
at the fair.

230
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,666
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

231
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,125
I want this one on a boat
to Stillwater prison.

[Silco]
There are always mishaps in battle.

238
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,291
The Firelights were her target
and most are dead.

239
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,958
It wasn't a mishap,
she froze up and lost her shit.

240
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,333
I could've handled those brats.

241
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,375
- She's a problem and we all know it.
- [Silco] We?

Who's we?

I expect better from you than excuses.

00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,541
It was your job to make sure
things went smoothly.

245
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,958
You failed. Don't disappoint me again.

The world's growing smaller
every day, thanks to the Hexgates.

250
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,833
And now, we're cut off.

251
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,916
The topsiders are leaving us
further and further behind.

252
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,791
What happened?

253
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,791
[Jinx] She already told you.

254
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,583
I'm asking you.

[object thuds]

256
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,958
[Jinx] One of those Firelight wackos
was a girl.

257
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,833
- With pink hair.
- [Silco] Hmm...

258
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,291
Your sister's gone.

259
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,000
You know that as well as I do.

260
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,250
I know. I know. Sisters, right?
[chuckles]

261
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,500
You can't live with 'em, can't stuff
'em back in the ol' babymaker.

263

Today's screw-up will set us back weeks.

264

I'm sorry.

265
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,500
- I need to know that I can rely on you.
- Phew.

266
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,458
I'm doing this for us, Jinx. All of us.

The sons and daughters of Zaun
deserve more than their runoff.

268
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,458
It won't happen again.

269
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
[Silco] I know.

Sevika will clean up today's mess.

274
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,625
Sevika? That ogre couldn't clean
a dust bunny with a blowtorch.

275
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:51,000
She'll suffice.
You should focus on your gadgetry.

276
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,250
[Jinx] Ugh.

277
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Take some time.

I don't need time.

Hmm... Would she?

[Elora] Tired of mingling?

288

[Mel] Hmm. These people have nothing new
to offer me.

289
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,750

is him.

291

[Mel] To what do I owe the pleasure?

It's Heimerdinger.

When is it not?

302

[Jayce] We've shown him our research.

It's Progress Day.

311
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:46,750
Heimerdinger is a great scientist.
But he's old. He only ever sees the past.

312
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,958
Piltover needs a leader who looks forward.

313

Someone like you.

00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,916
You really believe that?

Hextech has the potential
to change everything.

The world is ready.

317
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,875
And I've already spoken
to several potential investors.

Investors?

319
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,083
Of course.

320

Everyone wants Hextech for themselves.

I got confused, that's all.

Sevika's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot.

I'm not weak.

334
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,166
And I'm gonna show him.

335
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,458
Oh, I'm gonna show him. You'll see.

They were asking
if I could do the address.

342
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,458
You should come up with me.
We're partners.

343

No, no. Not in front of all of them...

344
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,291
You... have your speech prepared?

that we suspend all Hextech operations

Have you lost your mind?

437

[Shoola] The Hexgates must remain open.

438
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:08,791
Piltover's status
as a global shipping lane depends on it.

439
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,875
Thousands would lose their income.

440

But shouldn't the safety of Piltover
be our first priority?

It appears we are at an impasse.

If we shut down the Hexgates,
the city will suffer.

447
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,000
But if we do nothing,

448

we leave ourselves vulnerable
to malefactors.

What are you suggesting?

452

Mr. Talis has demonstrated
his commitment to our safety.

453
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:57,583
He's willing to sacrifice
his own enterprise.

454
00:30:57,666 --> 00:31:00,541
And it seems to me only Mr. Talis

455
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,625
has the knowledge necessary
to secure the Hexgates.

456
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:07,041
I propose that a new chair
be brought forth,

457

00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,750
[groans]

530
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,750
This is the best I could do.

531
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:06,500
I don't need charity, Councilor.
Yours or my parents'.

532
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,500
- Cait.
- Get out.

533
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:13,958
[sighs]

534
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,041
- [retreating footsteps]
- [door opens]

535
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,208
[foreboding music plays]

536
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,958
[owl hooting]

537
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,041
[boat creaks]

538
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,376
[Caitlyn] I need to speak
with one of the inmates.

539
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:44,416
Oh, folks in here
aren't usually very talkative.

540
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,000
This one was hit by friendly fire.

541
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:50,791
He's got reason to talk.
Must have been sent in today?

542
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:56,166
Oh. Inmate 2135.

543
00:35:56,916 --> 00:36:00,375
[warden]
<i>Yeah, I'm, uh, afraid that's not possible.</i>

544
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,000
- Why not?
- Uh, well, there's been...

545
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,541
<i>- an incident.</i>
- [Caitlyn] <i>What kind of incident?</i>

546
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:08,000
- [warden] <i>The...</i>
- [gasps, grunts]

547
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,916
<i>...not so pretty kind.</i>

548
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,208
[rattling]

549
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,916
[Caitlyn] <i>You don't understand,
I have to talk to him.</i>

550
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:20,458
[warden] <i>Oh, you'll be able to.
As soon as he can move his jaw again.</i>

551
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:22,578
[Caitlyn] <i>Who assaulted him?</i>

552
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:26,166
[tense music plays]

553
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:32,333
[loud thud]

554
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,166
[thudding continues]

555
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,333
Who the hell are you?

556
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,416
[tense music playing continues]
