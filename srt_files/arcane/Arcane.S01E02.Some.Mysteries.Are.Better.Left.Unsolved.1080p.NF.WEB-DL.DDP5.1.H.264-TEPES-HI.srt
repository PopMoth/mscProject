00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,875
Hmm.

180
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,708
This one.

181
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,875
But that's...

182
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,333
[stutters]
Well, that's a child's toy.

183
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,916
[chuckles]
Good.

184
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,458
[classical music plays]

185
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,291
[Mrs. Kiramman] The boy's got ambition.

186
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,135
It's why we supported him
in the first place.

187
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,000
[Mr. Kiramman] Ambition?
Darling, he nearly blew up our daughter.

188
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,083
[Caitlyn] Jayce had nothing
to do with that. He was robbed.

189
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,666
- We need to help him.
- [Mrs. Kiramman] Caitlyn's right.

190
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,666
We've known Jayce for years.
Besides, we're his patrons.

191
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,791
If anyone is meant
to speak up for him, it's us.

192
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,458
We should hit them back.
We've got the numbers to beat them.

193
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,625
Yeah. Let's teach them
what it means to mess with us.

194
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,916
[all] Yeah!

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,291
[crowd shouting in agreement]

196
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,750
- You sure that's what you want?
- [stall holder] Let's do it.

197
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:32,083
We crossed that bridge once before,
and we all know how that ended.

198
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,875
You're just protecting your kids.

199
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,083
I'm protecting our people.
I'd do the same for any one of you.

200
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,708
We look out for each other.
It's the way it's always been.

201
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,916
This will blow over.
We just need to stand together.

202
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,708
The Vander I knew,
the one who built the underground,

203
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,708
wouldn't be afraid to fight.

204
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,708
- Do I look afraid?
- No.

205
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,833
You look weak.

206
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,666
[Claggor] Why isn't he doing anything?

207
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,333
We kicked the Enforcers' butts
with just the four of us.

208
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,291
Imagine what the whole
of the Lanes could do.

209
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:19,125
- Jeez, even Powder wants to fight.
- So, why aren't we?

210
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,583
[indistinct chatter]

211
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,125
Spill it, Ekko.

212
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,125
Um...

213
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:35,833
Oh, okay. Well, um, Vander's got a deal
with the Enforcers.

214
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,500
What deal?

215
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,083
[suspenseful music plays]

216
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,000
For your birthday, Councilor.

217
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,375
Ah, Mel, this is too kind.

218
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,791
[Mel] I'm told it was built only
for the sharpest of minds.

219
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,916
[stammers]
And I bought you some Ginko nuts.

220
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,208
[screams]
Don't you know I'm allergic?

221
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,333
What are you trying to do?

222
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,696
- Kill an old man?
- [door opens]

223
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,583
[suspenseful music playing continues]

224
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,625
[crowd muttering]

225
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,791
[Mrs. Kiramman] Jayce Talis.

226
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:53,500
You are accused of illegal experimentation
and endangering the citizens of Piltover.

227
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,166
What do you have to say for yourself?

228
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,875
The materials were far more dangerous
than I was aware of,

229
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,583
and I... I now know my actions
were against Academy regulations.

230
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:14,291
What I did endangered people.
It was reckless, and for that, I'm sorry.

231
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:19,375
I ask the Council's forgiveness,
and I hope that I can continue my studies.

232
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,458
As Jayce's patron of many years,
I can speak for his character.

233
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,166
I believe that one day,

234
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,500
he will be a great contributor
to our society.

235
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,666
He destroyed a building.

236
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,333
Is this the sort of contribution
we can expect?

237
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,851
[Heimerdinger] If you were a scientist,

238
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,416
you'd know you can't make a prototype
without breaking a few wrenches.

239
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,250
Do you have anything to show
for your work besides an explosion?

240
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,916
Uh, no. It came to nothing.

241
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,625
[Mel] So, you're saying
your study was meaningless?

242
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,583
- It was revolutionary!
- Revolutionary how?

243
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:54,250
All I see is a boy meddling with things
he doesn't understand.

244
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,041
The Academy seems
to have loosened its standards.

245
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,666
This is a fine line.
If we condone this, what's next?

246
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,958
[Salo] Ridiculous, really.

247
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,976
[Shoola] The Council has more
important matters to deal with.

248
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,041
[Mel] Perhaps we should just finish this...

249
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,833
I was trying to create magic.

250
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,875
[crowd exclaiming]

251
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:10,958
[crunches]

252
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Magic?

253
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,750
Arcane talents are something
you're born with.

254
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,000
They can't be fabricated.

255
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,041
Actually, I believe it is possible.

256
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,250
Has anyone even tried it before?

257
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,125
[Bolbok clears throat]

258
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:33,000
The Arcane is the curse of our world.
My race was nearly destroyed by it.

259
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:37,375
Surely, we, the pioneers of science,
can use it for good.

260
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:41,333
We're the champions of discovery.
Why fear it when we can master it?

261
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,416
Jayce, enough.

262
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,416
This is the city of progress,
think of the wonders we could create.

263
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,541
- Let me prove...
- [Heimerdinger] Enough!

264
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,875
You don't understand what's at stake.

265
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,375
But how can you?

266
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,541
That's a burden that only I here carry.

267
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,791
Time.

268
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,041
<i>I've seen this power in the wrong hands.</i>

269
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:11,166
<i>It corrupts, consumes,
lays waste to civilizations.</i>

270
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:17,458
That cannot happen here, my boy.
It must not.

271
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,333
Heimerdinger is right.

272
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,916
Piltover was founded to escape
the warmongering of mages,

273
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,250
- not cultivate it.
- [Bolbok mutters]

274
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:30,208
The Ethos is clear.
He must be banished from Piltover.

275
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,125
[gasps]

276
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,166
[crowd muttering]

277
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,500
[Ximena] Please, let me speak!

278
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,208
[footsteps approaching]

279
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,833
As a lower house, my voice
doesn't carry much weight here.

280
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,458
But as a mother,
I have a voice that matters deeply.

281
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,250
My son isn't in his right mind.

282
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,958
His entire life,
he's chased an impossible dream.

283
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:59,000
What he did was, uh, foolish and unwise.

284
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:04,208
But he has a good heart.
Please, let him come home.

285
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:08,666
A crime like this can't be overlooked.
The boy must be punished.

286
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,166
A violation of the Ethos
calls for banishment,

287
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,250
but I can sympathize with a young man's
dream to change the world.

288
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,583
Perhaps in this matter,
a lesser sentence may suffice.

289
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,625
I move that Jayce be summarily expelled
from the Academy

290
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,541
and remanded to the care of his parents.

291
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,375
All those in favor?

292
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,458
[ominous music plays]

293
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,958
[Heimerdinger]
You may take your son home, Mrs. Talis,

294
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,416
but he is to never set foot
on Academy grounds again.

295
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,750
[door whirring]

296
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,333
[disembodied voices]

297
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,458
[approaching footsteps]

298
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:29,291
First time I've been invited to the Lanes.
It better be worth my time.

299
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,083
Ah, you see, that's your weakness, Marcus.

300
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:37,333
You carry your chin so high,
you fail to see the opportunity below.

301
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,541
[Marcus] Who are you?

302
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,583
You're looking for four children,

303
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,708
the ones running circles
around Piltover's finest.

304
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,041
[Marcus] What about it?

305
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:51,000
Don't look so concerned.
I'm about to make your day.

306
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,000
- [thunder rumbling]
- [rain pattering]

307
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,041
[knocks on door]

308
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,416
- [door opens]
- [Ximena] Can I come in?

309
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,458
Hmm.

310
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,833
I still remember the look on your face
when you found these.

311
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,541
[sighs]

312
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:22,083
Jayce, please. If I hadn't spoken,
you'd be lost to me.

313
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,000
I had to say something.

314
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,833
Magic saved your life.

315
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:33,916
Yes, but it won't save yours now.
You need to let it go.

316
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I could've convinced the Council.

317
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,708
If my own family won't help me,
I'll find someone who will.

318
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,833
[dramatic music plays]

319
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,041
[Heimerdinger] Oh. That foolish boy.

320
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,250
[Viktor] Yeah, I must admit,
his theory intrigues.

321
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,833
If dangerous ideas
didn't excite the imagination,

322
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,500
we would never wander astray.

323
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:06,541
Could it work? Could these stones
really invoke magic?

324
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,958
Nonsense. It's far too unstable.

325
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,041
Could you stabilize it?

326
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,291
Me? Why would I?

327
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,166
That only leads to more problems,

328
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,458
and that poor boy
has enough of them already.

329
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:22,500
There. Come tomorrow morning,
his research will be safely disposed of.

330
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,208
[Heimerdinger] Lock up.

331
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:30,416
No, no, no. Magic is far too dangerous
in the wrong hands.

332
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,625
[Silco] Will he live?

333
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,875
[Singed] Long enough.

334
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,291
[water gurgles]

335
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,666
Beautiful, aren't they?

336
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,166
Yet, up there on the surface,

337
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,458
no one even knows they exist.

338
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,666
They're monsters.

339
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,958
There's a monster inside all of us.

340
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,583
What? No. No, no! It'll kill me!

341
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,833
I'd like to let you in
on a very important secret

342
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,458
I learned when I was about your age, boy.

343
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,500
You see, power,

344
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:28,208
real power doesn't come to those
who were born strongest,

345
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,833
or fastest, or smartest.

346
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,416
No.

347
