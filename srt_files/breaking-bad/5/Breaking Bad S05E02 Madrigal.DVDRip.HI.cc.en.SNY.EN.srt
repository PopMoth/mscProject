180
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,907
I'm proud of you,
brother. Yeah, yeah.

181
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:16,308
So how many<i> Krauts</i> we got?

182
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,843
Enough to invade Poland.

183
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:21,213
Came in their own
G5, just like Oprah has.

184
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:23,282
G5, yeah? Mmm-hmm.

185
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:26,052
Is that one where the...
Where the wings go up like that?

186
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:27,619
I think they all do that.

187
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:29,055
They all have that?

188
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:30,990
Anyway, we got two U.S.
Attorneys in the house.

189
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,325
Big doings. Your
name keeps coming up.

190
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,144
Yeah? Hey, give me a
hand here, would you?

191
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,879
Just... Just a little
bit there. Thanks.

HERZOG: <i>I hired
Peter Schuler in 1992.</i>

193
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,953
Almost single-handedly,

194
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,021
he grew our little
restaurant division

195
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,257
into an industry leader

196
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,828
and a source of
great personal pride.

197
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,664
I am shocked and
saddened by his death

198
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,766
and outraged by the damage

199
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,870
his actions have wrought
upon my grandfather's company.

200
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,672
[SPEAKS GERMAN]

201
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,175
Alleged actions.

202
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,678
An innocent man
does not kill himself.

203
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,214
My people and I
are here to help.

204
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,183
To your investigation,
I pledge Madrigal's

205
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,740
full cooperation
and transparency.

206
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,074
I confess I have
my selfish reasons.

207
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:25,610
I believe Peter Schuler
was a lone anomaly.

208
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,746
But if that is not the case,

209
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,331
I want to know it,

210
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,455
just as you do.

211
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,704
So when you gonna announce it?

212
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,539
I don't know.

213
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,759
As I'm walking out the door
with my big cardboard box.

214
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:42,361
Can't do that.

215
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,963
You know damn well we're
gonna throw you a big party.

216
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,205
Damn straight. We're
talking a blowout.

217
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:56,375
Outstanding police work, Hank.

218
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,698
If only I'd listened.

219
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,435
But I guess the damage was done.

220
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,123
It's not right, them
putting this on you.

221

Somebody's gotta
go under the bus.

Ramey's a good man.

223
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,478
He'll do right by you.

224
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,303
Besides, this office
practically runs itself.

225
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,406
Bullshit it does.

226
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,459
Sir.

227
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:32,061
What's with that APD
thing? The electromagnets?

228
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,662
They're thinking it's
about Fring's laptop.

229
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,731
Turns out a couple of
days before it happened,

230
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:39,101
desk sergeant gets this phone
call from a "postal inspector,"

231

they keep the thing.

233
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,474
And he told them? Jesus.

234
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,443
Anything left of the laptop?

235
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,379
[SCOFFS] Do we look that lucky?

236
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,616
You know, I sneaked a peek
before APD took it out of Fring's office.

237
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,518
The whole thing was encrypted.

238
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,159
They wouldn't have got
anything anyway, but...

239
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,347
So Hector
Salamanca killed Fring.

240
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,029
But who gave Salamanca the bomb?

241
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,598
[SIGHS] Whole lot of questions

242
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,550
and not much in
the way of answers.

243
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:13,051
Yet.

244
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:16,209
The APD did find some
of Fring's financials.

245
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,547
That just might
lead to something.

246
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,406
I had him out to my house.

247
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,450
4th of July.

248
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,736
We cooked out in the backyard.

249
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,074
My son shucked the corn.
My daughter cut up potatoes.

250
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:36,992
Fring brought sea bass.

251
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,360
Every time I grill it now,

252
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,247
I make a little foil pouch,
just like he showed me.

253
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:45,000
That whole night,
we were laughing,

254
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,384
telling stories, drinking wine.

255
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,196
And he's somebody
else completely.

256
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,366
Right in front of me.

257
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,970
Right under my nose.

258
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,985
Hi. What can I get you?

259
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,753
Just tea, please. Chamomile.

260
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,354
Oh, sorry. We don't
have chamomile tea.

261
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,324
Then some sort of bergamot,
provided it's not Earl Grey.

262
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,125
I like soy milk
instead of dairy.

263
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,279
We don't have soy milk
or any sort of bergamot.

264
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:49,915
Wow. You're really running
me through my paces here.

265
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,283
Uh-huh.

266
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:53,835
Well, English
Breakfast, I guess.

267
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,337
We have Lipton's.

268
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,878
That's pretty much all we have.

269
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,010
I would like a cup
of hot water, filtered,

270
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,378
if possible, and a
single slice of lemon.

271
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,681
And I'm assuming
you don't have Stevia?

272
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,339
Never mind. I brought my own.

273
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:15,090
You coming to me,
or am I coming to you?

274
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:18,015
Face forward.
We'll talk like this.

275
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,246
I guess I'm coming to you.

276
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,088
Ohh.

277
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,191
Mmm.

278
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,077

279
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,834

one's gonna see you here.

282
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,088
How did I not see
you sitting back there?

00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,352
So weird. [CHUCKLES]

284
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,842

00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,277
No.

286
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,001
I'm good, Fran. Thanks.

287
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,690
Now,

288
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,938
how about we lose
the sunglasses?

289
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,229
I feel like I'm talking
to Jackie Onassis here.

290
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,235
There you go.

291
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,205
Breathe in, breathe out.

292
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,175
Drink your whatever.

293
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,632
Who killed Gus?

294
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,136
Haven't I told you not
to worry about that?

295
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,344
Now, what do you want from
me, and why is it so important?

296
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,194
What's this?

297
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,062
A list of 11 names.

298
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:45,530
Okay.

299
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,254
You know them all.

300
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,203
I do.

301
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,639
Those 11 men... And I
think you know this, Mike.

302
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:56,224
Those 11 could sink
us, you and me both.

303
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,993
Where are we going
with this, Lydia?

304
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,128
No specific. I'm just
pointing out facts.

305
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,497
These men... Your
men... Yours and Gus's...

306
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,966
These men were on
the payroll, very publicly.

307
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,735
They trace back to
Pollos and the laundry.

308
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,221
They trace back to Madrigal, and
they're gonna get picked up by the police.

309
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,289
And when they do,
when they get picked up

310
00:22:10,313 --> 00:22:11,590
and threatened with prosecution,

311
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:13,859
and there's only one way
out for them, they're gonna...

312
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:16,428
And I'm not saying
all of them, okay?

313
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:18,730
All it's gonna take is
two or three, or even one.

314
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,699
But there's always a
weak link somewhere.

315
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:23,151
But they're gonna talk. At least
one of them's gonna talk about you,

316
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,587
about me, and that's
all it's gonna take.

317
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:29,124
These are the 11 I know
of, but I'd love your input.

318
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:31,259
I never met your
chemist, for instance.

319
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,667
I'd love your input.

320
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,369
You want me to kill
every man on that list?

321
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:43,339
Wow. That's a leap,

322
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,207
what you just, uh...

323
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,447
No, I didn't say that.

324
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,502
But if you think
that'd be wise...

325
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,104
[SIGHS]

326
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,602
You're scared, aren't you?

327
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,604
Yeah.

328
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,206
You're very upset,

329
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,263
which I'm gonna factor
into my response here.

330
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:09,097
These are my guys,
and they are solid.

331
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,500
Understand? What about
Chow at the warehouse?

332
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,568
Didn't one time you have to
shoot him through the hand?

333
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,620
You think that didn't
stick in his memory?

334
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,389
What about Dennis
at the laundry?

335
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:19,074
They're sure to pick him up.

336
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,548
They already have. They
picked him up last night.

337
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:25,597
My guys are solid.

338
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:28,266
I vetted them with great care,

339
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,335
and Fring made sure they
were well compensated

340
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,587
in the event of a
situation such as this.

341
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,756
They're paid to
stand up to the heat,

342
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,726
keep their mouths
shut, no matter what.

343
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,217
And they will.

344
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,649
Now, I don't know what kind of
movies you've been watching,

345
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,468
but here in the real world,
we don't kill 11 people

346
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,660
as some kind of
prophylactic measure.

347
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,225
Look at me

348
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:55,081
and say you understand.

349
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,118
I understand.

350
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,449
I get it.

351
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,539
So we're off that
very silly idea?

352
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,611
Good.

353
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,337
Drink your hot water.

354
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:30,979
I gotta go.

355
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,547
Did you have enough?

356
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,349
Yeah. I'm good.

357
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,683
Okay.

358
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,235
[QUIETLY] Bye-bye.

359
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:38,336
Bye. Bye.

360
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,605
Bye, big brother. [CHUCKLES]

361
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,162
Say bye to Mom for me.

362
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,977
I will. Have a good day.

363
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,281
You, too.

364
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:50,165
[DOOR OPENS]

365
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,501
[SIGHS]

366
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:54,191
[DOOR CLOSES]

367
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,212
[QUIETLY] Skyler. Mmm...

368
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,480
Hey.

369
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,416
The car wash
opens in 15 minutes.

370
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,341
Mariano can open for me today.

371
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,715
Hey, how about you get up, huh?

372
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:23,353
Come on.

373
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,283
A shower will feel good.

374
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,142
Hey, Chow.

375
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,457
How you holding up?

376
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,693
Okay.

377
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,650
You know, they... They...

378
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,481
They talked to me.

379
00:25:56,505 --> 00:25:59,072
You can't smoke in here, Chow.

380
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:21,640
HANK: <i>Thanks for coming down.</i>

381
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,409
Have a seat, Mr.,
uh, Ehrmantraut.

382
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:26,233
Am I, uh, saying that right?

383
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:29,547
Close enough.

384
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:32,701
So, once more, you're waiving your
right to have an attorney present?

385
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:34,570
Correct.

386
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,738
Could you state that
to the camera, please?

387
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,774
I'm waiving my right to
have an attorney present.

388
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:43,111
Uh, okay, then. We just
have a few questions.

389
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:46,414
You're currently employed
by the Pollos Hermanos chain.

390
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,149
Is that correct? Yes, I am.

391
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,183
And what do you do there?

392
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,535
Corporate security.

393
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,804
Corporate security. Yeah.

394
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:56,541
What's that? Like, uh,
guarding the special sauce?

395
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,877
I conduct employee
background checks.

396
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:01,679
I oversee loss prevention.

397
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,550
At a fast-food restaurant,
that's a full-time job?

398
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:08,720
We have 14 locations.
So, yes, it's a full-time job.

399
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:10,188
Yeah, well, [CHUCKLES]

400
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,757
If I were you, I'd start
sending out those resumes.

401
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:16,027
It says here you're a
private investigator?

402
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,261
Where you licensed?

403
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,230
New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.

404
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:21,149
Every state where we operate.

405
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,919
Colorado? You have some
restaurants there, right?

406
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,287
Colorado doesn't
require licensure.

407
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,156
You licensed to carry a firearm?

408
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,557
Concealed carry? Yes, I am.

409
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,326
Which states?

410
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,195
It'd be quicker to mention
the states in which I'm not.

411
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,931
And if we pulled your C.C.P.'s,

412
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,699
everything would be in order?

413
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:40,374
I'm guessing you've already
done that, so you tell me.

414
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,807
You strike me as a former cop.

415
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,180
Am I right?

416
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:50,217
Where at?

417
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:54,849
Philadelphia.

418
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,619
Philly. [CHUCKLES]

419
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:58,903
The city of brotherly love.

420
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,774
Turns out we, uh, we
know some folks there,

421
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,593
and they told us that your
tenure as a police officer

422
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:09,698
ended somewhat,
uh, dramatically?

423
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:11,833
You wanna talk about that?

424
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,168
Not particularly.

425
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,542
Yeah, me neither.

426
00:28:16,712 --> 00:28:18,940
See, I'm more interested
in why Gus Fring

427
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,376
decided to put a guy like you

428
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,678
in charge of his
corporate security.

429
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:28,099
I mean, given your history

430
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,519
doing background checks
on pimple-faced fry cooks.

431
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,438
Seems like overkill.

432
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,807
What else you do for Fring?

433
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:40,250
He must've needed help running
that drug empire of his, no?

434
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:42,981
Drug empire?

435
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:45,700
First I'm hearing about that.

436
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,702
I don't know
anything about that.

437
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,488
Hey, man, we have a guy that
could put you in that underground lab,

438
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:52,073
and he'll testify to it.

439
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,243
So from here on out,
this can go hard or easy.

440
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,934
So what's it gonna be?

441
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,058
Forget your handcuffs?

442
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,426
I'm confused.

443
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,783
Am I under arrest
here, or am I not?

444
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,843
You wanna state
that for the camera?

445
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:31,112
You are not under
arrest, currently.

446
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,865
Agents, do you have any
more questions for me?

447
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:36,635
Because you've got
me very stirred up

448
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,887
with all these
false accusations.

449
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:41,790
If I'm not under arrest,
I'd prefer to leave.

450
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:44,092
Oh, well...

451
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,448
Uh-huh.

452
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,900
And I suppose we could talk
about the two million dollars

453
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,508
in your granddaughter's name.

454
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,191
Yeah. It seems, uh,

455
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,727
Fring had all these
secret offshore accounts

456
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:03,828
that he would
deposit money into.

457
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:06,064
Like, uh, well, an
even dozen of them.

458
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:07,232
And they're all in the names

459
00:30:07,256 --> 00:30:08,866
of certain people
on his payroll.

460
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,086
There was the, uh, the
manager of the laundry,

461
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,324
um, a couple guys from
the Pollos distribution center.

462
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:21,029
There was the owner of a chemical
warehouse, a bunch of others.

463
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,915
You know, guys that must've
been getting paid off the books.

464
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:29,642
Anyway, one of the names
was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.

465
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:35,844
Ten years old and
just cute as a button.

466
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:40,098
Yeah. Two million and change
we found on deposit for her.

467
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:41,399
Way more than anybody else.

468
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,869
Now, my partner here,

469
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:46,137
he took one look at
that and said, "Shit, man.

470
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:49,474
"This fifth-grade girl is the muscle
behind Fring's entire operation."

471
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:52,360
I said, "Whoa, whoa. Hey,
partner, slow down there.

472
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:53,995
"Maybe it was actually

473
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,486
"her dear old granddaddy."

474
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,419
Impressive, no? That...
[CLICKS TONGUE]

475
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,042
level of insight?

476
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:06,391
He's not impressed, Gomie.

477
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:10,027
Perhaps he's picturing all
that money going bye-bye.

478
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:11,963
Yeah, well, I mean,

479
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:15,255
the government's gonna
take every last dollar, unless...

480
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,355
Well, here's the thing,
Mike... Or Michael?

481
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,607
Mr. Ehrmantraut.
Here's the thing, Mike.

482
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,442
Lucky for you, you
didn't touch that money.

483
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,612
I cannot say the same
for the other 11 on the list.

484
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,864
One of your guys
is gonna roll on you,

485
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,200
and then we'll definitely
remember the handcuffs.

486
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:37,322
Now, before that day comes,
you can do yourself a solid.

487
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:40,158
You can tell us what you know,

488
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:43,261
you can tell us
who's still out there,

489
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:45,018
and if we like your story,

490
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:48,599
good things can happen.

491
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:51,252
Kaylee might be able to
keep some of that money.

492
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,638
Maybe.

493
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,161
HANK: So what do you say?

494
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:02,768
I don't know anything
about any money.

495
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:06,773
I don't know what
you're talking about.

496
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,316
WALTER: First order of business

497
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,067
is to find a new place to cook.

498
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:25,937
Before anyone says
it, no more RV's.

499
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:29,207
I don't know. The crystal
ship did pretty good for us.

500
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:30,942
The "crystal ship"?

501
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:33,077
Yeah. That's what I called it.

502
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:36,480
Well, I'll admit, it held
its own as a starter lab,

503
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:39,216
but it was too dark, too small,

504
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,219
not to mention it could've
broken down at any moment.

505
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:45,590
Saul, find us someplace
safe from prying eyes.

506
00:32:45,614 --> 00:32:48,092
Security against
detection is paramount.

507
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:49,594
But I don't wanna drive too far.

508
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:52,630
No more 50-mile treks to
some Indian reservation.

509
00:32:52,654 --> 00:32:54,265
In town is trickier.

510
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:57,235
I mean, you got a lot
more of your prying eyes.

511
00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:01,077
If Gus can manage
it, then so can we.

512
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:07,166
Precursor. Where
are we with that?

513
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:10,181
Uh, we're good on everything

514
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:14,018
except, uh, methylamine.

515
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:15,920
No surprise.

516
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:17,955
It's dry as hell out there.

517
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:20,291
What if we switched
back to a pseudo cook?

518
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:22,460
Absolutely out of the question.

519
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:25,195
Jesse, there is methylamine
out there. I know it.

520
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:27,298
Yeah, but what if there's not?

521
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:29,200
Because there isn't.

522
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:30,968
I mean, really.

523
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:32,854
There is.

524
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,444
Have faith.

525
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:37,692
Can I... Can I offer a thought?

526
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:38,976
Uh...

527
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,212
Say a guy wins the lottery.

528
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:43,915
Ten million bucks.

529

00:44:58,813 --> 00:45:02,114
about, uh, Ted...

710
00:45:03,651 --> 00:45:05,251
Everything.

711
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:09,822
It'll pass.

712
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:31,410
[SIGHS]

713
00:46:03,311 --> 00:46:06,190
When we do

714
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:09,014
what we do for good reasons,

715
00:46:14,722 --> 00:46:17,082
then we've got
nothing to worry about.

716
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:24,356
And there's no better reason

717
00:46:26,334 --> 00:46:27,666
than family.
