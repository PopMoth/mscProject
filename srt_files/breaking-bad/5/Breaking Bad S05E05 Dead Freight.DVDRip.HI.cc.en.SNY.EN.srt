supervising a
shipment of chemicals,

177
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,741
when I noticed a device

178
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,243
<i>on the bottom of one of
our barrels of methylamine.</i>

179
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,246
A device? <i>Yeah. I guess</i>

180
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,246
you'd call it that.

181
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,232
I'm certainly no expert,

182
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:17,136
but it... [STUTTERS] It looks
to me like some kind of a...

183
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,523
A tracking device
or... Or a GPS.

184
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,626
Huh. <i>So I was just wondering</i>

185
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,361
if maybe your
people put it there.

186
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,912
Not that it's any
of my business,

187
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,914
but the last thing I
wanna do is interfere

188
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:33,002
with a law enforcement
operation or a sting...

189
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,658
Or whatever you call it.

190
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,673
So, I don't know.

191
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,043
Maybe you could give
me some guidance?

192
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,412
Uh, well, I'll tell you what.

193
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,564
Set that barrel aside
for me, if you would,

194
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:47,116
and I'll look into it
and get back to you.

195
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,502
And in the meantime,
mum's the word, all right?

196
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:52,621
Yeah. All right. Sure thing.

197
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,123
<i>Okay, great. Thanks
for the call, Ms. Quayle.</i>

198
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,064
<i>Bye-bye. [CLICKS]</i>

199
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,863
[EXHALES FORCEFULLY]

200
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,470
[DRUMMING FINGERS]

201
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,473
Hey, Gomie, come
here, would you?

202
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:07,819
Yeah? Hey, man.

203
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:09,405
<i>You don't know anything
about GPS trackers</i>

204
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,740
<i>on a methylamine barrel, do you?</i>

205
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,759
<i>Madrigal Houston
I'm talking about.</i>

206
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:16,879
GOMEZ: <i>No. Nobody from
my team planted anything. Why?</i>

207
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,765
<i>Oh, I don't know.
I figured as much.</i>

208
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:21,773
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

209
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,922
I know what you're
thinking, but I didn't do it.

210
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm telling you, I
didn't plant that thing.

211
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,608
Shut up.

212
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:31,444
And there you
have it, like I said.

213
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:33,412
All right. So now what?

214
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,148
It's not the DEA's,

215
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,550
so Schrader's probably
thinking some crew planted it,

216
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:39,685
looking for a weak
spot to pull a heist.

217
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,338
He's gonna send a team
over to that warehouse.

218
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,073
He's gonna wire
it out the wazoo.

219
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,691
Bugs, cameras,
the whole nine yards.

220
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:48,027
So the warehouse is too hot.

221
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:50,329
Her supply is useless to us now.

222
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:54,150
It depends on how fast
Schrader can get his guys there.

223
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,319
We're 900 miles
closer, after all.

224
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:59,605
I say we keep listening, suss
out how much time we have.

225
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:02,208
If it's at least 12 hours,
then we head down there,

226
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,177
use her security
code to gain access,

227
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,345
and we take every barrel
we can get our hands on.

228
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,330
U-haul can only
take six or seven

229
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,882
before the suspension gives out.

230
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,533
It's a stopgap.

231
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,317
But right now, it's
the best we can do.

232
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,474
[WHISPERING]
Well, what about her?

233
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,110
MIKE: [SIGHS] You two drive

234
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,950
the barrels back tonight.

235
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,781
I'll deal with her.

236
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,734
No! No, no, no. You're
making a mistake.

237
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:31,803
This... This was not me! I
swear to god I didn't do it!

238
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:34,222
I don't know, man. It sounds
like she's telling the truth to me.

239
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,559
She has a gun to her head, kid.

240
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,229
Everyone sounds like Meryl
Streep with a gun to their head.

241

I'm sorry, Jesse.

242

You're the one who
wanted to put it up to a vote.

243
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,708
It's two against one.

244
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:51,990
No. No! You can't
kill me! Come on!

00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:54,227

<i>Jesus. Are you shitting me?</i>

there with hazard suits, Hank.</i>

bottom. They were well-hidden.</i>

well-hidden enough.</i>

00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:41,981
<i>All of them. All the ones that were
headed to the warehouse, anyway.</i>

00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:44,493
<i>Christ. All right.</i>

265
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,545
<i>Well, sit tight. Let me
figure out how to play this.</i>

00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,247
<i>Next time, a little
communication first, all right?</i>

267
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:50,716
<i>Yeah, I... I'm sorry about that.</i>

268
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,106
Asshole.

00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:59,091
[WHISPERING] Aside...
Aside from the fact

270
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,726
that we almost
killed this woman,

271
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,729
all of those barrels
are already marked.

272
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:05,697
We solve the problem we can.

273
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:08,717
This has not changed the
equation one iota for her.

00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,053
Oh, come on! You
are not seriously

275
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,722
still considering killing me?

276
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:16,208
I saved you! If it weren't for
me, we'd all be in jail right now!

277
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:19,679
I hate to say it, but
she's... She's right, Mike.

278
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:22,798
She saved our asses
by finding that thing.

279
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:26,118
She was saving herself.
She's a loose cannon.

280
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:28,771
I am telling you, she will
turn a gun or a badge on us

281
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,628
the first chance she gets.

282
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,758
The woman

283
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:35,400
put a hit out on me.

285
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,650
Wait. A hit?

286
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,341
What? Like the mafia?

287
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:46,838
Yeah, like the mafia.

288
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,925
Hey! You still need
methylamine, don't you? Right?

289
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,510
You wanna talk methylamine?

290
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,845
Then tell your partner
to stop threatening me,

291
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,381
and let's talk.

292
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:57,933
Talk about what? You heard.

293
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,186
You can't even get
us a single barrel.

294
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,254
Who said anything about barrels?

295
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,047
I'm talking about
an ocean of the stuff.

296
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:16,869
Just give him a
minute, would you?

297
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,870
Trust him.

298
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,339
"Trust him."

[LAUGHS]

300
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:28,113
Okay. So, let's hear it.

301
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:31,250
Not without a guarantee that once
I tell you how to get what you want,

302
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:33,285
I won't be killed anyway.

303
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,988
Fine. You have my
word. Not good enough.

304
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:37,389
[CHUCKLES] Look, lady...

305
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,258
Do you have children?

306
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:41,410
That has nothing
to do with this.

307
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:45,014
It's not a trick question.
Why don't you just answer it?

308
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:48,283
Yes, I have children. So what?

309
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,519
You think that somehow
because we're both parents

310
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,754
that I won't let my partner
do what's necessary?

311
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,873
Swear on their lives. Oh, what?

312
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:57,375
Swear on your children's
lives that I won't be harmed.

313
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,661
Otherwise, how can I trust you?

314
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,299
Look, you're a smart
businesswoman.

315
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,284
You understand the
concept of leverage.

316
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:06,835
Please don't patronize
me. I hate that.

317
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,759
You have none.

318
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:17,445
But trust has to work
both ways, Lydia.

319
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,304
Is it true that you
put a hit out on Mike?

320
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,803
Yes.

321
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,794
Why? I was scared.

322
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,574
Of Mike?

323
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:31,677
Not at first.

324
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:34,530
There are men who used to work
with Gus Fring in custody right now.

325
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,349
Nine of them. They know
everything about me. Everything.

326
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:38,867
Some of them even
know about you,

327
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,352
assuming you're
the master chemist

328
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:42,296
they're always talking about.

329
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:47,593
And if it's these nine
that you're worried about,

330
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:49,427
why put the hit on Mike?

331
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:51,046
I had no choice. I'm
not going to prison

332
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,365
and have my daughter raised
in some horrible group home.

333
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:56,301
Do you have any idea
what those places are like?

334
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,969
I gave him a list of names,

335
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,439
but instead of handling
it, he's protecting them.

336
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:02,173
So I hired someone
else. At that point,

337
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:05,482
there was no option
but to add Mike to the list.

338
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,585
This ocean of methylamine

339
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:16,377
that you claim you
can get your hands on,

340
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,609
how much are we
talking about, literally?

341
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,701
How does 24,000 gallons sound?

342
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,934
Once a week, on a Wednesday,

343
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,935
a freight train leaves
the Port of Long Beach

344
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,371
loaded with
industrial chemicals.

345
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,074
There's always at least one
tanker car full of methylamine,

346
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,594
which we import from a
manufacturer in guangzhou.

347
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,413
The train travels
east through Arizona,

348
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:43,916
stops at a rail yard
outside flagstaff

349
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,484
where it gets broken
down and rebuilt.

350
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:47,436
But the methylamine
always moves on,

351
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,339
destined for our pesticide
concerns in Texas and Oklahoma.

352
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,042
Which means that it passes
right through your home state.

353
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:56,362
There's a remote
three-mile stretch here,

354
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,681
in McKinley county.

355
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,570
That's where you do it.

356
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:04,469
That's where we
do what, exactly?

357
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:05,820
Get your methylamine.

358
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,991
Like, rob it? Like Jesse James?

359
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,760
You want the stuff? I'm offering
you enough to fill a swimming pool.

360
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:15,614
You are offering us a quick trip
to prison. That's what I'm hearing.

361
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:18,049
Stopping a train, post 9/11?

362
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,935
You have any idea
how many alarms

363
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,604
that's gonna set off
between here and DC?

364
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,690
None, if you do it right here.

365
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:26,691
If a freight train is
stopped in transit

366
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:28,844
anywhere other than
the usual yards or depots,

367
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,895
absolutely, a signal
will automatically alarm

368
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,349
the FRA and the
TSA surface division

369
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,666
at the Department
of Homeland Security.

370
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,751
But what you don't
know, and I do,

371
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,005
because my job requires me to
keep track of my buyers' shipments,

372
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:42,491
this is dark territory.

373
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,194
What's that? Train-speak
for an area of no contact.

374
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,329
It's a dead zone.

375
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,131
No automated supervision system,

376
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,534
no alarms, no
contact with control.

377
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,035
What about cell phones?

378
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,771
Crew could just call the
cops. No cellular either.

379
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,924
I'm telling you, it's
the perfect place.

380
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,109
You'd have time
enough to stop the train,

381
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,728
siphon off as much
methylamine as you can carry,

382
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,030
and get away
before the police...

383
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:06,932
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

384
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:10,168
Assuming we can
stop a moving train,

385
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:12,054
how do we know we
have the right one?

386
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,089
And which tanker car is which?

387
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,809
I can't believe that they
would advertise their contents.

388
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,010
Once the train gets
rebuilt in Flagstaff,

389
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,713
a final manifest gets uploaded
to my company's server.

390
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:25,116
I'll have it for you sometime
between midnight and 2:00 AM.

391
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,591
That'll give you at least
six hours of lead time.

392
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,888
Keep in mind,

393
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:32,040
I'm taking a huge risk
supplying this information.

You know what this
means, don't you?

397
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,834
We've gotta off the crew.

398
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,853
How do you figure?

399
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,972
Well, if we don't, the
engineer's gonna call the cops

400
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,974
as soon as he gets
out of the dead zone.

401
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,594
It's only three miles long. But
we're way out in the boonies.

402
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,529
I don't care if it's
in the Gobi desert.

403
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,865
Once they get word, the
FBI and Homeland Security

404
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,700
are gonna swoop down
with choppers on us

405
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,385
so fast it'll make
our heads spin.

406
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:03,022
And there is no hiding
in that open country.

407
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:05,056
How many in the
crew? LYDIA: Just two.

408

no security guards.

410

No guards. It's not like we're
carrying nuclear warheads.

411
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:13,682
Wait. Two guys.

412
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,818
Can't we just tie
them up or something?

413
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:18,487
And then what? Even
if we wear a mask,

414
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,072
we're leaving two
witnesses behind.

long enough to know

417
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,713
that there are
two kinds of heists:

418

guys get away with it

419

that we'd be making

Yes, sir. I'll be ready.

All right.

522

you a question?

523
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:38,783
No. Go ahead.

524
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:41,152
Well, I get why we want
the tank for the methylamine.

525
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:42,726
But why this other
one for the water?

526
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,162
Well...

527
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,176

528

529
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,014
It's all about the weight, yo.

530
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,498
The tanker we're gonna hit,

531
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:56,250
it gets weighed once when
it gets loaded in Long Beach,

532
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,404
and then again when
it's unloaded in Texas.

533
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,339
If the weights don't match,

534
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,363
the train company's
gonna know it got robbed.

535
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,143
Okay.

536
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:08,113
Boosting methylamine from
a train is, like, a major rap.

537
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:11,316
The point is, no
one other than us

538
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,503
can ever know that
this robbery went down.

539
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,160
Nobody. You got it?

540
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:21,415
Yeah. Absolutely.

541
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:24,262
Are you sure?

542
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,164
Yes, sir.

543
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:27,966
With all that said,

544
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,452
the whole thing relies on us

545
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,070
replacing the weight
of methylamine we steal

546
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:33,904
with the same weight in water.

547
00:28:33,928 --> 00:28:36,274
Right on. So they'll never
know we hit them. Cool.

548
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,542
Aqueous methylamine
is water-based,

549
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:40,578
yet it weighs slightly
less than water.

550
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:43,114
So, we will be removing

551
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,217
a thousand gallons of
methylamine from the tanker car,

552
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:47,618
but replacing it

553
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,688
with about nine-tenths
of that volume in water,

554
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:54,447
which comes to 900.24 gallons.

555
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,578
Actually, Jesse,

556
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,596
let's make that an even 920

557
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,632

whatever will remain in the hose.

But won't they figure out
they got robbed anyway

562
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:11,342
on account of getting
watered-down methylamine?

563
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,678
Well, out of 24,000 gallons,

564
00:29:13,702 --> 00:29:18,616
it'll only amount to about
four percent dilution, so...

565
