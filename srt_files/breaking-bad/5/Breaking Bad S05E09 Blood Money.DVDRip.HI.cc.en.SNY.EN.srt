00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:49,585
Listen, tell everybody
more work and less worry.

528
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:53,785
ARTIE: Guess we
better hit it. Yeah.

529
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,909
Yeah.

530
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,091
WALT: Hey, guys. SCOTT: Walt.

531
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,609
How are you? WALT:
Good to see you.

532
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:20,161
SCOTT: How you doing?

533
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:22,329
WALT: Well, you know, I
can't complain. Heh, heh.

534
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,682
How's your son's arm? I
was thinking about that.

535
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:26,851
ARTIE: Back to 100
percent. Going to district.

536
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,652
WALT: Gonna be
exciting. This Saturday?

537
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,087
ARTIE: This Saturday morning.

538
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:32,073
I think first pitch
is at 10 a.m.

539
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:35,076
Yeah, yeah. It'll be fun.
WALT: Should be a big crowd.

540
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,711
Guys, you're still on
the clock here! Let's go.

541
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,646
ARTIE: See you, Walt.
WALT: See you, Artie.

542
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,421
All right, Scott. Be well.

543
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:49,273
They're good guys, huh?
Yeah, they're good guys.

544
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:51,592
Well, it's good to
see you up and about.

545
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,026
Yeah. How are you feeling?

546
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,118
Well, you know.
I've been better, but...

547
00:40:57,756 --> 00:40:59,533
Yeah. Have you...?

548
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,569
Did you get to see
a doctor? I mean,

549
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:04,338
when one of these things
lasts more than three days,

550
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:05,906
you really should
get that checked.

551
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,776
Yeah, no, I did, and I'm fine.

552
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,678
I'm, what they say, on
the upswing, you know?

553
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,519
Mm. Good. Good to hear. Yeah.

554
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,937
When I heard you weren't
going in to work, I... Well...

555
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:22,940
Looks like you have
the work coming to you.

556
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:25,409
Perks of being the boss, huh?

557
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:27,850
Eh, you know...

558
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:32,383
How's, uh...?

559
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,684
How's things at the car wash?

560
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,970
Good. Yeah?

561
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,810
Yeah, really good.

562
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:42,481
Hey, did you have any
of that potato salad?

563
00:41:44,386 --> 00:41:45,863
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe.

564
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:47,581
Yeah, I mean, no
one else got sick,

565
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,072
so I probably
shouldn't worry about it.

566
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,190
Well, Skyler will be
very happy to hear

567
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,825
that you're feeling better.

568
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,351
Which reminds me,
I better get back to it.

569
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:06,556
If there's anything I can do...

570
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:14,681
Feel better.

571
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,457
[SIGHS]

572
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:28,894
You know...

573
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:32,325
you're gonna laugh,

574
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:36,030
but I have to ask
you about this.

575
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:40,300
Believe it or not, I
found this on my car.

576
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,420
I mean, it looks just
like the GPS tracker

577
00:42:42,444 --> 00:42:45,689
that we used on
Gus Fring, doesn't it?

578
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:48,765
Back when we were
tracking him, just the two of us.

579
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:53,419
You wouldn't know anything
about this, would you, Hank?

580
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,199
You okay?

581
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:13,568
I gotta say, I
don't like the way

582
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,492
you're looking at me right now.

583
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:31,969
It was you.

584
00:43:31,993 --> 00:43:34,671
All along, it was you!

585
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,274
You son of a bitch.

586
00:43:37,298 --> 00:43:39,710
You drove into traffic to
keep me from that laundry.

587
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:42,296
Calm down.

588
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,932
That call I got, telling me
Marie was in the hospital,

589
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,889
that wasn't Pinkman.

590
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,021
You had my cell number.

591
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:52,857
You killed 10 witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

592
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:56,199
Listen to me. You
bombed a nursing home.

593
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,697
Heisenberg. Heisenberg.

594
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,334
You lying, two-faced
sack of shit.

595
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:05,035
Hank.

596
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,205
Look, I don't know where this
is coming from, Hank, but just...

597
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,207
I swear to Christ,

598
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,225
I will put you under the jail.

599
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:13,994
Take a breath, okay?
Listen to yourself.

600
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,530
These wild accusations,
they could destroy our family.

601
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:17,865
And for what?

602
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,822
You don't give a
shit about family!

603
00:44:26,314 --> 00:44:29,260
Hank, my cancer is back.

604
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:32,195
Good.

605
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:35,666
Rot, you son of a bitch.

606
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,090
I'm sorry you feel that way.

607
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:41,489
I wanna beat this thing, I do.

608
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,680
I'm back on chemo,
and I am fighting like hell.

609
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,580
But the truth is, in six months,

610
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,938
you won't have
someone to prosecute.

611
00:44:54,476 --> 00:44:56,687
But even...

612
00:44:56,711 --> 00:45:02,081
Even if somehow you were
able to convince anyone

613
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,347
that I was capable
of doing these things,

614
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,115
you and I both know

615
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:12,341
I would never see
the inside of a jail cell.

616
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:19,443
I'm a dying man

617
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,244
who runs a car wash.

618
00:45:21,268 --> 00:45:25,938
My right hand to God,
that is all that I am.

619
00:45:30,545 --> 00:45:32,478
What's the point?

620
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:40,681
Have Skyler bring the kids here.

621
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:43,488
And then we'll talk.

622
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,545
That is not going to happen.

623
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,503
I don't know who you are.

624
00:45:59,707 --> 00:46:02,575
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

625
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,464
If that's true...

626
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:13,302
if you don't know who I am...

627
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:20,509
then maybe your best course...

628
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:24,847
would be to tread lightly.

629
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,069
