about 15 seconds

176
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,155
before he decided to
help Walt track you down.

177
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,991
You see, Goodman's
got a trace on your phone

178
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,693
and as soon as you call him

179
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,828
Walt will find out
where you're hiding.

180
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,220
Then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

181
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,286
Oh, man. Oh,
man. I swear to God,

182
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,954
I didn't know he was
gonna kill the man.

183
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:36,456
I didn't know he
was gonna kill him.

184
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,157
Relax.

185
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,543
If we thought you
did, you'd be in lockup

186
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,944
for conspiracy to commit murder

187
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,612
instead of here
under our protection.

188
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,297
Tell us everything
you know about White

189
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:47,133
so we can get him
before he gets you.

190
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:49,067
Why would he wanna kill me?

191
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:51,471
I ain't do nothing. Who
knows with this guy?

192
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,606
From what he said,
it may have to do

193
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,208
with him tying up loose ends

194
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,915
regarding poisoning
some kid named Brock.

195
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:02,231
Or maybe it's because you
know where his money is.

196
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,200
I don't know where his money is.

197
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,601
That ain't what we heard.

198
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,937
You ain't listening to
the people in the know.

199
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,123
Me and Kuby rented
a van for the dude,

200
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,992
loaded his cash up
in a self-storage unit

201
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:15,712
handed over the keys
to him at Goodman's.

202
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,014
Who knows where
he took it from there?

203
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,883
A van, huh? How
much money we talking?

204
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,086
Seven barrels' worth.

205
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,559
Seven barrels?

206
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:30,209
When you say "barrels,"
you mean "barrels" barrels?

207
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:35,548
Barrels, man. You know,
plastic, black, 55-gallon type.

208
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:37,150
I got them at Home Depot.

209
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,585
Filled up every last
damn one of them too.

210
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:43,106
And where did you rent the van?

211
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,998
Lariat. The one on
Candelaria and Monroe.

212
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,781
Lariat on Candelaria? Yeah.

213
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:55,317
Kuby rented the van.
Mr. White dropped it off.

214
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,121
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

215
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,522
Wash the rental? Why?

216
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,508
It was filthy, man, like
he went off-road with it.

217
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,760
After we had hosed it down,

218
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,628
he grabbed a shovel out the back

219
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,531
handed over the
key, and that was it.

220
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:09,870
That's all I know.

221
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,639
All right, Mr. Babineaux.

222
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:21,177
Agent Gomez and I are
going to do everything we can

223
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,745
to find this son of a bitch.

224
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,480
Like I said, you're free to go.

225
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,650
But if I were you, I wouldn't
take one step out that door.

226
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,319
GOMEZ: And
remember, no phone calls.

227
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,087
Oh, actually, I almost forgot.

228
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,290
Uh, I took the liberty
of removing the battery

229
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,709
so Walt can't track you by GPS.

230
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,645
So don't put that back in.

231
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,914
Agent Van Oster will
stay here with you.

232
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:44,333
You're in good hands. He's
our best man with a gun.

233
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,501
Don't discuss the case with him

234
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,171
because the less
you distract him

235
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,008
the better he can protect you.

00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,468

to keep you safe.

241
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:23,873
Yeah.

242
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,046
So, what are we
talking, rat patrol?

243
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:30,730

No, he's not a rat.

246

He's just...

247
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,444
He just won't listen to reason.

248
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,730
Okay. He's just angry.

249
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,482
He's not a rat.

00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,987
Angry non-rat. Got it.

252
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:56,755
How angry we
talking, by the way?

253
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,708
Like, Hulk angry?

254
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:03,584
Like, Rambo-James
Bond badass individual?

255
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:10,575
Not something you'd
do yourself, huh?

256
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,778

my nephew here, that's all.

Absolutely not.

Look, what was the price
per head last time? I'll triple it.

I'm sorry to just barge
in on you like this,

have a moment to talk with you.

but I've been trying
to reach him for days.

314
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,085
I've stopped at his house,

315
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,955
I've left all kinds of
messages on his voicemail

calling the police?

name is Saul Goodman.

ways of finding Jesse

Yeah. I... I did that.

that Jesse's not locked up,

but, otherwise,
very little help.

You see, the thing is,

333
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:26,641
is that Jesse and I had
this argument recently.

with the details, but he's...

He's... He's pretty
upset with me and...

336
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,705
And I'm hoping that's the
reason he hasn't called me back

it, he's mad at you,
