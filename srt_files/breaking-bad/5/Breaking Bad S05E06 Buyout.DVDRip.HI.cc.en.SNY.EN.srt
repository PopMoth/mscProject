this stuff smells like cat piss.

[GRUNTS]

00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:13,363
TODD: I mean, I'm
sorry, but I had to do it.

5
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,686
Obviously, I guess
you see it different.

6
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,702
Some of you. But I didn't
see any other choice.

7
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,004
I've been thinking
about this all day,

8
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,072
going over and
over it in my head,

9
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,536
and it was the only
way. [SCOFFS]

10
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:29,446
Well, it's not like I wanted to.

11
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,380
The kid was on a dirt bike.
I mean, he could've just...

12
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,015
He could've just
gunned it and been gone

13
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,884
before we even had
a chance to blink.

14
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,453
We never would've
been able to catch him.

15
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,087
I was thinking on my
feet. I saw a threat,

16
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,089
and I took care of it
the only way that I could.

17
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,958
A threat?

18
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,710
The kid was waving at us.

19
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,746
He wasn't going
anywhere. He was saying hi.

20
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,981
Yeah, but you don't know that.

21
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:49,449
Yeah, I do.

22
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:50,767
He didn't know what he'd seen.

23
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,602
Well, I didn't want
to take that chance.

24
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,537
I... The whole point of
this thing was that no one

25
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,007
was supposed know that
we were even there, right?

26
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,475
People weren't ever supposed
to know that anything got robbed.

27
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,878
How could we
have let the kid go?

28
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,446
He made us. If I
hadn't done what I did,

29
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,015
the whole mission
would've failed.

30
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,521
I'm... I'm real sorry.

31
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,853
I really am, but I...

32
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,522
But did I make a mistake?

33
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:16,292
Mr. White? 'Cause to
me, you know, respectfully,

34
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,493
I was looking out for the team.

35
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,694
I didn't want to kill him.

36
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,947
You gotta believe that.

37
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:25,051
At the end of the day, it
was him or us, and I chose us.

38
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,842
And I would do it again.

39
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,641
Okay, look. Uh...

40
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,611
Todd, why don't you step
outside for a few minutes

41
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,646
so we can talk this through?

42
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,382
Of course. Yeah, you guys talk.

43
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,984
But I just want to make sure

44
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,619
that you know that my
priority is this business.

45
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,438
Okay. That's... That's
fine, Todd. Thank you.

46
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:48,591
I want to be a
real part of this.

47
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,959
All right? If you could
just see that. I'm motivated.

48
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,329
And I've got connections.

49
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,397
Yeah. My uncle's got
his hookups in prison

50
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,921
who I think could be
a real help to us if...

51
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:09,428
Okay. That dude? Whack-job.

52
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,964
Let's just stick
to the facts here.

53
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:13,399
Facts? Oh, okay. uh...

54
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,501
How about the fact
that he shot a kid?

55
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,554
A kid that he didn't
need to shoot.

56
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,989
The boy had seen us.

57
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:23,064
And, no, it didn't look like
he knew what he was seeing.

58
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:27,797
But what if he told somebody?

59
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,734
What if he just
mentioned it in passing?

60
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,718
We can't know what someone...

61
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:36,822
Exactly. We can't know, because
Ricky Hitler there shot him.

62
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:40,209
We, us three, should've
had a discussion about it.

63
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,445
We would've figured it out.

64
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,515
But that dickhead just went
ahead and made the choice for us.

65
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,833
Is that how we do business now?

66
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,168
Look, I understand you're upset.

67
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:50,069
And what was that
crap about his uncle

68
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,805
with the... with the
prison connections?

69
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,841
It's just some bullshit
intimidation move.

70
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,642
Come on.

71
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,245
It's true, though. He does
have some connections.

72
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:00,913
Is this a problem?

73
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,700
No. It's nothing to
be concerned about.

74
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,052
It came up in the
background I did on him.

75
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:08,175
Didn't worry me
then. He's just flexing.

[SIGHS]

77
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,310
All right.

78
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,746
It seems to me that we
have three options here,

79
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,748
and none of which are ideal.

80
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,718
One, we fire Todd.

81
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:25,321
Yeah. I'm not a
fan of this option,

82
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:29,358
seeing that he knows way too
much about this business at this point.

83
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,896
And we'd most likely have
to pay him to keep quiet.

84
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,000
And God only knows we've
got enough of that going on.

85
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,123
Two...

86
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:41,877
We dispose of him.

87
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:51,319
Which leaves us option three.

88
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:54,300
We keep him on payroll.

89
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:56,269
Put him back on tenting houses,

90
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:57,654
setting up the lab and so forth.

91
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:01,624
We keep him close.
Under our control.

92
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,949
Now, option three
would be my choice.

93
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,919
Shall we vote?

94
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:12,673
MIKE: I vote three, kid.

95
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,525

I was just in the neighborhood.
Anything going on?

104
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:52,718
No. He's just hanging
out with his granddaughter.

What? A dead drop.

109
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,252
He just stashed something
underneath that trash can.

Write the time down. Roll on it.

111
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,950
Looks like he's leaving now.

112
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:55,180

113
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:57,082
Nope, not that I can see.
