fit a lab in here?

like that for days.

at a tented house.

199

200

to investigate? No.

four houses a week?

that's best for us.

we go in, we cook a batch,

208
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,700
we bomb the place, and leave.

209
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,070
So we gotta move in
and out for every cook?

then take everything down?

They don't boost anything
while they're on the job.

225
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:50,346
They copy the keys, locate
the valuables and alarms,

226
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,381
and they sell that
information to other crews.

simple shakedown,

705
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:33,844
simple as that.

706
00:42:33,868 --> 00:42:36,948
We're paying for their
silence. That's blackmail.

707
00:42:38,373 --> 00:42:40,306
Business is my end.

708
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,227
This is business. End of story.

709
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:48,743
This is your problem.

710
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,377
It should come out of your end.

711
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,769
Hey. Hey. Just
take it out of mine.

712
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,515
All right? Go for it.

713
00:42:57,191 --> 00:42:58,871
I don't care. Just take it.

714
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:11,415
Well, Jesse, thank you,

715
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:13,884
but no.

716
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:15,107
I'll pay my share.

717
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,693
Go ahead.

718
00:43:23,384 --> 00:43:25,184
[SIGHS] Let me
tell you something.

719
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:29,372
This

720
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,820
is how it's gonna be

721
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:35,756
from here on out.

722
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,227
My guys are an
ongoing expenditure,

723
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:43,052
so you best get yourself
comfortable with it.

724
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,097
137,000.

725
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,862
[LAUGHS]

726
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,926
That's less than with Fring.

727
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:03,950
Listen, Walter.

728
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,041
Just because you
shot Jesse James

729
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,378
don't make you Jesse James.

730
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,354
MIKE: Tomorrow.

731
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,705
How are you feeling?

732
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,591
Okay, I guess.

733
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:43,057
Broke it off with Andrea.

734
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:44,346
I had to.

735
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:47,016
She's gonna tell Brock.

736
00:44:49,837 --> 00:44:52,082
I'm still gonna take
care of the rent and stuff.

737
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,984
It's the right thing to
do, but, you know...

738
00:44:54,008 --> 00:44:56,053
I meant this.

739
00:44:56,077 --> 00:44:58,197
How are you feeling
about the money?

740
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:01,425
You're looking at it wrong.

741
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,427
When we worked for Gus,

742
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,196
we were cooking
200 pounds a week.

743
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,431
This last batch was great,

744
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,967
but we didn't even
crack 50 pounds.

745
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:14,004
We maybe cleared less money,
but we got a bigger piece of the pie.

746
00:45:14,028 --> 00:45:15,339
It's like you said,

747
00:45:15,363 --> 00:45:17,896
we're owners, not employees.

748
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:24,716
I've been thinking about Victor.

749
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:27,284
Yeah?

750
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,719
Yeah.

751
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:32,122
All this time,

752
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,392
I was sure that
Gus did what he did,

753
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:37,483
to send me a message.

754
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:42,383
Maybe there's another reason.

755
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,307
Like what?

756
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,990
Victor trying to cook
that batch on his own?

757
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,974
Taking liberties that
weren't his to take?

758
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:57,320
Maybe he flew too
close to the sun,

759
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:00,089
got his throat cut.

760
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,410
