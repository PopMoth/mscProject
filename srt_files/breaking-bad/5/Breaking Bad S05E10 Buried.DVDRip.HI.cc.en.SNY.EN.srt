KALANCHOE: I promise you we
can hold out just as long as you can.

531
00:44:37,325 --> 00:44:40,271
That's a fact. I got a bladder
the size of a hot water bottle.

532
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:42,139
Man, all that cash.

533
00:44:42,163 --> 00:44:44,141
I wouldn't be able to
stop talking about it.

534
00:44:44,165 --> 00:44:46,644
I know. But I don't think I'd
be tossing it out my car window.

535
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:48,178
KALANCHOE: Heh-heh. Yeah.

536
00:44:48,202 --> 00:44:51,314
My take-home doesn't allow
for that whole Robin Hood thing.

537
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:53,517
But apparently
Jesse is raking it in.

538
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:54,918
MUNN: Yes, indeed.

539
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,238
I'm sure he's got a perfectly
reasonable explanation

540
00:44:57,262 --> 00:44:58,305
for where he got it.

541
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,007
Sure. He found it.

542
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,742
Or won it in a card game, maybe.

543
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:03,710
That's it. Won it
in a card game.

544
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,546
Lucky night at the casino.

545
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,604
KALANCHOE: Jesse,
did you have a lucky night?

546
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:16,440
Okay. Jesse, we're gonna
let you gather your thoughts

547
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,309
so we can continue this
stimulating conversation.

548
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:23,780
Can we get you
anything? Coffee? A soda?

549
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,981
Right.

550
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:28,769
Yeah. Thought not.

551
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:30,726
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

552
00:45:38,353 --> 00:45:41,031
I have a history
with Jesse Pinkman,

553
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:42,633
and I think he can
be helpful to me

554
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,169
on another active investigation.

555
00:45:45,193 --> 00:45:49,173
Look, I'm only asking
for a couple minutes here.

556
00:45:49,197 --> 00:45:50,740
You said he wasn't talking?

557
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:54,011
Let me tell you, that
kid hates my guts.

558
00:45:54,035 --> 00:45:56,013
Despises me, okay?

559
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:59,350
Maybe I can get him cranked
up enough that he starts yapping.

560
00:45:59,374 --> 00:46:00,751
Then you guys go in,

561
00:46:00,775 --> 00:46:02,986
get what you need
from the little shit-stain,

562
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,188
finish him off.

563
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:07,691
Gives me anything
useful while he's with me,

564
00:46:07,715 --> 00:46:09,782
I'll share it, 100 percent.

565
00:46:11,085 --> 00:46:13,697
I could use a smoke break.
Yeah. How about you?

566
00:46:13,721 --> 00:46:17,501
Yeah. Maybe you could keep
an eye on our suspect for us,

567
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:18,669
just for a few minutes.

568
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,787
Absolutely. I can do that.

569
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,089
Okay.

570
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,545
All right, guys.

571
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:48,904
