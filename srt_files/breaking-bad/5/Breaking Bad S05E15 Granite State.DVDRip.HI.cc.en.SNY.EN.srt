<i>to shore up the stock price
of Gray Matter Technologies</i>

711

association with Walter White.</i>

712
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,586
ELLIOTT: <i>That's
not exactly the way...</i>

713
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,688
ROSE: <i>To cleanse
yourselves, so to speak,</i>

714
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:35,125
<i>of having a
methamphetamine kingpin</i>

715
00:50:35,149 --> 00:50:37,661
<i>as cofounder of your company.</i>

716
00:50:37,685 --> 00:50:39,763
ELLIOTT: <i>Charlie, I'm
glad you brought that up.</i>

717
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:43,667
<i>I have to believe that the
investing public understands</i>

718
00:50:43,691 --> 00:50:46,887
<i>we're talking about a person
who was there early on,</i>

719
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,857
<i>but who had nothing to do
with the creation of the company</i>

720
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:52,526
<i>and still less to
do with growing it.</i>

721
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,430
ROSE: <i>So, what was
Walter White's contribution?</i>

722
00:50:56,454 --> 00:51:00,150
ELLIOTT: <i>You know,
to be honest... Honey?</i>

723
00:51:00,174 --> 00:51:02,552
<i>The company name.
The company name.</i>

724
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:05,421
<i>We came up with it by
combining our names.</i>

725
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:06,690
<i>"Schwartz" means "black."</i>

726
00:51:06,714 --> 00:51:07,958
<i>Black plus white makes gray.</i>

727
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,327
<i>Hence Gray Matter Technologies.</i>

728
00:51:10,351 --> 00:51:12,129
ELLIOTT: <i>Exactly.
As far as I can recall,</i>

729
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:14,331
<i>his contribution
begins and ends there.</i>

730
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:17,400
ROSE: <i>There are continuing
reports of blue methamphetamine,</i>

731
00:51:17,424 --> 00:51:19,870
<i>considered his
signature product,</i>

732
00:51:19,894 --> 00:51:21,271
<i>throughout the Southwest</i>

733
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:24,674
<i>and some evidence of
reaching as far as Europe.</i>

734
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:26,509
<i>So my question is,</i>

735
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:29,412
<i>is Walter White still out there?</i>

736
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:31,565
GRETCHEN: <i>No, he's not.</i>

737
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:35,169
<i>You sound very sure.</i>

738
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:36,570
GRETCHEN: <i>I am.</i>

739
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,506
<i>I can't speak to this Heisenberg</i>

740
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,142
<i>that people refer to,</i>

741
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:45,645
<i>but whatever he became,</i>

742
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,815
<i>the sweet, kind, brilliant man</i>

743
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:53,169
<i>that we once knew
long ago, he's gone.</i>

744
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,239
ROSE: <i>But to be
absolutely clear...</i>
