You know, I have to

again, Uncle Hank.

358
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,195
Thanks.

359
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,881
I'll see y'all later.
WALT: All right.

360
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,049
All right. Have
fun. Bye. Be safe.

361
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,884
Drive safely, okay? I do.

362
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,788
HANK: Slow down. Never.

363
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:55,029
Hmm.

364
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,247
A hell of a couple
cars there, Walt.

365
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:03,965
Honey, for my next birthday,

366
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,918
I'm gonna take a
page here from Walt

367
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:07,536
and buy myself a jet plane.

368
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,139
WALT: Well, maybe
I overdid it a little.

369
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,924
But with these
new lease rates...

370
00:22:12,948 --> 00:22:15,093
I mean, they're
mighty attractive.

371
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:16,500
Yeah.

372
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,272
Great dinner, Skyler.

373
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:30,058
Those were some bad-ass
whipped potatoes, I tell you.

374
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,561
You have to tell me how
you get all the lumps out.

375
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:33,701
How do you do that?

376
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,848
A potato ricer.

377
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:39,223
A ricer? You don't hand mash?

378
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:42,943
No.

379
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,167
Well, uh... Boy, it has...

380
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:58,070
It has been quite a
year, huh? [CHUCKLES]

381
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:00,773
Do you know that, uh,

382
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,709
it's almost exactly a year ago

383
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,577
that I got my diagnosis?

384
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,262
Jesus. Yeah, right? Yeah.

385
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,926
Seems like longer, doesn't
it? Yeah. No. it's, uh...

386
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,624
One year ago tomorrow.

387
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,076
The day after my 50th.

388
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,010
Honestly never thought
I'd make it this far.

389
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:25,213
The cancer and surgery

390
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,150
and Hank being shot...

391
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,506
It just...

392
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,126
So many dark days.

393
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,923
Well... [CHUCKLES]

394
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,459
There's Marie's talking pillow.

395
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,203
Remember that? [CHUCKLING]

396
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,514
It was... [MUTTERS]

397
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:45,089
Boy, I did not want
to get any treatment.

398
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,343
I think I was too scared

399
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,309
or too angry or...

400
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,466
I don't know. I
just wanted to quit.

401
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,988
But you guys... You got
me through it somehow.

402
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,908
Kept me going.

403
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,359
And that happened
again and again and again.

404
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:13,211
I mean, there were times

405
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:15,319
when I was sure I was done for.

406
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:20,207
But then someone or something

407
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,794
would come through for me.

408
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:28,176
God. And Skyler... I can't...

409
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,429
Honey, remember that
first week of chemotherapy?

410
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:34,032
That night on the
bathroom floor?

411
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,422
What you said to me?

412
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,305
I was so sick.

413
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:42,229
It was rough going at first.

414
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:46,011
But Skyler...

415
00:24:46,035 --> 00:24:48,930
She was right there, of course,

416
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,066
putting wet washcloths
on my forehead.

417
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,518
And she's singing to me.

418
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:56,371
And this would go on and on,

419
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:59,090
day after day.

420
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:02,994
And I remember I was lying
on the floor of the bathroom,

421
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:06,152
because the tile felt
nice and cool, you know?

422
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:10,202
And my head was in Skyler's lap,

423
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:13,405
and I was just asking her

424
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,462
if this could all be over.

425
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,211
It was too hard. It was...

426
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:21,980
I just wanted it stopped...

427
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:24,154
Skyler, isn't that freezing?

428
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,343
HANK: Whoa. Hey-o. Pool party.

429
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,141
What are you doing,
Skyler? [CHUCKLES]

430
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:36,011
What is she doing? Walt?

431
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,413
Hey, uh, Sky, maybe
it's time to get out now.

432
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:39,915
What do you think?

433
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,217
Skyler, Hank asked
you a question.

434
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,274
You need to get out... Skyler!

435
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,256
She's gonna come up, right?

436
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,446
She has to.

437
00:25:57,907 --> 00:25:59,183
[MUFFLED] Skyler,
you need to get out.

and I got a 900-mile drive back.

That's 14 hours if I don't stop.

So the sooner we do
this, the sooner it's done.

Uh, Ehrmantraut.

Up there. Number 22356.

That's the one I erased
from the inventory,

474
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,138

heard a little bit about that.

think that...

that there may be some issues

and leave you and Skyler

537
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:09,137
to look after each other.

538
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,739
Uh, that's very
generous of you, Marie,

539
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,993
but I... I just don't see
how that's a solution.

540
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,196
And... I mean...

541
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,316
Besides, Junior and
Holly... That's a lot of work.

542
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,035
No, it isn't.

543
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:25,336
Junior's independent,

544
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,340
and my niece is
only the easiest,

545
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,460
most delicious baby
that was ever born.

546
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,745
It'll be fun, right?
Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah.

547
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,014
Yeah.

548
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:39,300
Absolutely. Yeah.
It's a good idea.

549
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,986
I think it's a great idea.

550
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,377
Just the thing for both of you.

551
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:54,837
Marie, this idea...

552
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,420
Was it yours?

553
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,260
Actually, it was Skyler's.

554
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:05,916
Uh-huh.

555
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:09,302
She really needs this, Walt.

556
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,689
Yep.

557
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:25,713
I gave Marie bottles.

558
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,150
They'll stop and pick
up diapers along the way.

559
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,186
I spoke with Junior
on the phone,

560
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,756
and after much discussion,

561
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,958
he agreed to swing by
tomorrow, pick up some clothes.

562
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:39,377
And so, voila,

563
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:41,262
the kids are out of
this environment.

564
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,019
What a coincidence.

565
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,356
I know you're awake.

566
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:52,829
What was that about?

567
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,165
Can you explain it?

568
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,920
I don't want the
children here anymore.

569
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:02,833
It isn't safe.

570
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:07,906
Skyler, we have talked
about this repeatedly.

571
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,424
It has never been more safe.

572
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,909
"Never been"?

573
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:14,746
A couple weeks ago, a
man was coming to this house

574
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,164
to kill us, to murder
your entire family.

575
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,867
You were in the
crawlspace, screaming.

576
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,835
And I dealt with him. It's over.

577
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,721
It is not.

578
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:26,140
You're right back in
the meth business again.

579
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:29,443
This is different. Now
I'm running things.

580
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,380
So wait. Now that
you're in charge,

581
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,266
it's what... It's gonna be
smooth sailing from here on out?

582
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,218
I don't see why not.

583
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,876
I keep the work at work, Skyler,

584
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,058
and nothing will ever
impact you or the kids.

585
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,011
You don't know that. You
can't make that promise, Walt.

586
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:50,298
I can promise you
that Gus Fring is dead.

587
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,322
And he was the threat.
He was the danger.

588
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,678
I thought you were the danger.

589
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,212
Is that what your
pool stunt was about?

590
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,515
Trying to protect
my children from me?

591
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,705
Not just...

592
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:12,070
There's blood on my hands too.

593
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:13,642
What blood? Beneke?

594
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,608
He's in the hospital
because of me.

595
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,443
No. Because of what I did.

596
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,979
Skyler, you can't beat
yourself up over this thing.

597
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:25,049
Please. You didn't
set out to hurt anybody.

598
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:27,401
You made a mistake, and
things got out of control,

599
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,754
but you did what you had
to do to protect your family.

600
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:32,457
And I'm sorry. That doesn't
make you a bad person,

601
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:33,724
it makes you a human being.

602
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:37,962
Stop it, Walt. Just stop.

603
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:40,698
I don't need to hear any
of your bullshit rationales.

604
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,299
I'm in it now.

605
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:44,586
I'm compromised. But I won't...

606
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,655
I will not have my
children living in a house

607
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,776
where dealing drugs and
hurting people and killing people

608
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,846
is shrugged off
as "shit happens."

609
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,015
We're back at it? Fine.

610
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,301
But the kids stay
away, and that's that.

611
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,719
"That's that"? That's what?

612
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,671
I got them out of this house.

613
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:06,240
To a sleepover at
their aunt and uncle's?

614
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,443
They spend a day or two,

615
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:11,278
Junior stays up late watching
movies, and then what happens?

616
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,797
We'll see. No, I'll tell
you what happens.

617
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:16,284
They come home to this house,

618
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,719
to their parents who love them.

619
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:20,337
No. I will not let our
business endanger them.

620
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:22,306
How many times do I have
to say that they are not in...

621
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,808
I said no.

622
00:36:23,832 --> 00:36:26,549
I swear to God, I won't
have them back here.

623
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,891
What are you
gonna do to stop it?

624
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:41,993
Whatever it takes.
Everything in my power.

625
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:44,528
Like what? I mean, specifically.

626
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:46,447
What is your next move?

627
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,867
My next move is
maybe I hurt myself.

628
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:51,402
Make it clear we need more time.

629
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:53,504
Let Hank and Marie
see we're still struggling.

630
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:55,322
No, more like
you're still struggling.

631
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,658
So maybe next time,
I have you committed.

632
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,044
Put you in some
inpatient facility

633
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:01,629
while I take care
of the kids myself.

634
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,847
Is that what you want?

635
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:07,568
So then maybe I show
up with bruises on my neck,

636
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,220
give myself a black eye,

637
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:11,506
say that you beat me

638
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,563
when you found
out about my lover.

639
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:16,866
I see.

640
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,648
So you want to involve Ted?

641
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,299
Oh, well, that'll be fun,

642
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,685
bringing the police up
to speed on all of that.

643
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,888
But not as much fun as
telling your 16-year-old son

644
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,691
that his father
is a wife-beater.

645
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,849
Also not a very good
plan. What else you got?

646
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:35,847
I could send Junior
away to school.

647
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:37,915
Oh. Now here's
the conversation...

648
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:41,419
"So, honey, I know you've only
got one year left in high school,

649
00:37:41,443 --> 00:37:43,887
"but I would love it so much
if you would drop everything,

650
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:45,422
"leave all your friends behind,

651
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:47,425
"and go to boarding
school in Arizona."

652
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:49,693
You have any other ideas?
Because I'm not hearing

653
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:51,397
a solution to your problem.

654
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,765
How are you going
to save our kids

655
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:57,001
from this terrible environment?

656
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,502
I don't... What
are you gonna do?

657
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,371
Are you gonna run off to France?

658
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:01,922
Are you gonna close the
curtains, change the locks?

659
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,325
This is a joke. Come on, Skyler.

660
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,916
You wanna take me on? You
wanna take away my children?

661
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,303
What's the plan? I don't know!

662
00:38:12,274 --> 00:38:14,301
This is the best I could
come up with, okay?

663
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,254
I... I will count every minute

664
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:18,906
that the kids are
away from here,

665
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,810
away from you, as a victory.

666
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:23,316
But you're right.

667
00:38:24,285 --> 00:38:25,685
It's a bad plan.

668
00:38:27,422 --> 00:38:31,518
I don't have any
of your magic, Walt.

669
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,454
I don't know what to do.

670
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,623
I'm a coward.

671
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,992
I... I can't go to the police.

672
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,627
I can't stop
laundering your money.

673
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,579
I can't keep you
out of this house.

674
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:43,920
I can't even keep
you out of my bed.

675
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,869
All I can do is wait.

676
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,871
That's it. That's the
only good option.

677
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,673
Hold on,

678
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,742
bide my time,

679
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:55,932
and wait.

680
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,937
Wait for what? What
are you waiting for?

681
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,191
For the cancer to come back.

682
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:45,581
[BUZZING]

683
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:57,110
Yeah?

684
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,241
Okay. Okay.

685
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,105
Just relax. I'm coming.

686
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:19,259
JESSE: You tell me
what that looks like.

687
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,128
If the D.E.A.'s
tracking her barrels,

688
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,180
there goes our
precursor connection.

689
00:40:23,204 --> 00:40:25,749
That's done. And I'm
telling you, these days,

690
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:28,803
chances of getting a new
methylamine hook-up is rare, man.

691
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:30,420
It's like Bigfoot.
Like unicorn-rare.

692
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:33,829
Kid, it's just... You're
giving me heartburn here.

693
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,095
G.P.S. on the
bottom of the barrel.

694
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,364
Why didn't they put it inside
where nobody would see it?

695
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:42,366
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.

696
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,234
They made these
things to put under cars.

697
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:46,253
They can get wet.

698
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,954
Huh.

699
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,457
Even by cop
standards this is sloppy.

700
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,109
And the other barrels...

701
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:54,462
They have trackers
on the outside too?

702
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,369
I don't know. Probably.

703
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:01,301
You didn't check any
of the other barrels? No.

704
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,403
But that's the only one we
could've taken, according to her.

705
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,405
Once we spotted
it, she freaked out,

706
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,275
I put the barrel
back, and we F.O.'d.

707
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,278
Let me ask you something.

708
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,913
The person who spotted this...

709
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,697
Was it you or was it her?

710
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,513
Lydia. She saw it first.

711
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,237
Okay.

712
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:21,939
She's dead.

713
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:23,925
Wait, wait, wait. What?

714
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:26,527
Lydia planted this
thing, not the cops.

715
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,179
She's thinking if
she makes it look

716
00:41:28,203 --> 00:41:30,147
like her inventory's
being watched

717
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:33,083
that we'll leave her alone and
take our business elsewhere.

718
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:34,769
And she's right.

719
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:37,337
We will be taking our
business elsewhere,

720
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,007
right after I leave
her alone in a ditch.

721
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,509
But wait, hey, if the
D.E.A.'s not tracking her stuff,

722
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,545
that's a good thing, right?

723
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,447
I mean, all we
gotta do is tell her to,

724
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,699
you know, cut the crap and
keep the methylamine coming.

725
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:50,734
You don't know
this woman like I do.

726
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,071
I had a chance to deal with this
before, and I gave her a pass.

727
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,006
That's what I get
for being sexist.

728
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,241
Now, if you'll excuse me...

729
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,464
Mike, you can't just...

730
00:42:00,068 --> 00:42:02,112
Look, that's our
precursor. We need her.

731
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:05,632
Kid, if we have to ramp
down for a while, so be it.

732
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,367
It beats working with a lunatic

733
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,103
who's gonna get
us arrested or killed.

734
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:11,705
Look, she didn't seem
crazy to me, you know?

735
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,974
She just seemed, like, uptight.

736
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,209
And now you're being sexist.

737
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,646
Trust me, this
woman deserves to die

738
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,248
as much as any
man I've ever met.

739
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,272
No. Wait!

740
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,219
Just wait.

741
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,387
What if this really was
the cops, you know?

742
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,307
And what if you're wrong
about her? I'm not wrong.

743
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:33,043
But what if you are?

744
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:36,747
Jesse, your misgivings
have been duly noted.

745
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:39,283
Now move away from me.

746
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,468
No. This is a voting thing.

747
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,805
I don't think so. I
vote it's a voting thing.

748
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:47,074
Mr. White, weigh
in here, would you?

749
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,764
What do you think?

750
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:51,734
Mr. White?

751
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:03,362
The methylamine keeps
flowing, no matter what.

752
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:06,099
We are not ramping down.

753
00:43:07,102 --> 00:43:09,168
We're just getting started.

754
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,188
Nothing stops this train.

755
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:14,857
Nothing.

756
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:19,345
Hey, yo, Mr. White. Hold up.

757
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:24,400
I just wanted to
say I liked your idea.

758
00:43:25,987 --> 00:43:27,886
You know, it's pretty, uh...

759
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:31,023
I think it's the way to go.

760
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,757
Oh, hey, um,

761
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,015
you said it was your...
your birthday, so...

762
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,214
I left the receipt in the box

763
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:46,255
in case you wanna exchange it.

764
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,726
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.

765
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:07,960
Hi.

766
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:18,003
I, uh, stopped by
Hank and Marie's.

767
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,354
Junior is still asking,
"What is going on?"

768
00:44:23,378 --> 00:44:26,123
Nonstop, very
insistently. [CHUCKLES]

769
00:44:26,147 --> 00:44:28,825
But everything's okay.

770
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:30,800
They're watching <i>Ratatouille.</i>

771
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,268
It's very sweet.

772
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,073
How are you?

773
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,095
There's gonna be some
more money coming in soon.

774
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,385
Is that okay?

775
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,183
Fine.

776
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:54,306
Good.

777
00:44:57,845 --> 00:44:58,977
So...

778
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:01,881
Coming to bed?

779
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,391
I wanna show you something.

780
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,208
See that watch?

781
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,199
It's a birthday present.

782
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:40,430
The person who
gave me this present

783
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:42,204
wanted me dead too.

784
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,436
Not that long ago,

785
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,271
he pointed a gun
right between my eyes,

786
00:45:47,295 --> 00:45:48,461
right here,

787
00:45:50,064 --> 00:45:51,297
and he threatened to kill me.

788
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,418
He changed his
mind about me, Skyler,

789
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,255
and so will you.

790
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:21,110
[TICKING]

791
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:40,174
[TICKING LOUDLY]

792
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:41,346
[CLICKS]
