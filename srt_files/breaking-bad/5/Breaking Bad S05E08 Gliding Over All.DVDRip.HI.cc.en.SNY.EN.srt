Maybe I should brew up a batch.

542
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:33,764
What do you think?
Ooh, schraderbrau?

543
00:44:33,788 --> 00:44:35,332
Yeah. I vote yes.

544
00:44:35,356 --> 00:44:36,666
I second that.

545
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,486
Well, there you
go. It's unanimous.

546
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,820
Well, who am I to fly

547
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,638
in the face of public
demand, right?

548
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:43,162
[CHUCKLING]

549
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:49,163
All right. Hold on. [GRUNTS]

550
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,965
Anybody, uh... Anybody
want anything? Want anything?

551
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,351
No, I'm good. I'm
good, thank you.

552
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,553
All right.

553
00:44:55,577 --> 00:44:56,875
Does it look glossier?

554
00:44:57,979 --> 00:44:59,957
Do I have a halo? I don't know.

555
00:44:59,981 --> 00:45:03,160
How's she doing? She's good.

556
00:45:03,184 --> 00:45:05,664
Try not to put any of that
sunscreen on her fingers.

557
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:11,612
HANK: <i>"To WW, my star,</i>

558
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:13,947
<i>my perfect silence."</i> [CHUCKLES]

559
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:16,700
<i>WW.</i>

560
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:19,102
I mean, who do you
figure that is, you know?

561
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:21,388
Woodrow Wilson?

562
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:22,611
Willy Wonka?

563
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,450
Walter White?

564
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:30,069
[CHUCKLES]

565
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:32,487
You got me.
