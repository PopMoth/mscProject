all that shit...

Where did he keep it?

195
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:27,613
He had a laptop in his office.

of the restaurant.

this is a place that is

There's no way you're
getting it out of there.

about killing anybody.

I am, however, considering
the possibility of a device.

A device. Yes, a small device.

269
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,939
Say this device gets
filed into evidence.

270
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,507

of yours into evidence.

Who said bomb? I said a device.

Yo, what about, like, a

all it would take.

I'm not talking
about sprinklers.

00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,422
I'm talking about Halon,

280
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,224
because Halon doesn't
destroy evidence.

281
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,526
A magnet, though, maybe
like... All right, so a bomb, then.

282
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,862
Maybe we plant a bomb outside.

crew out of Fort Worth

take out a couple of hedges.

he's in Dutch with the IRS,

543
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,204
and once they audit,

544
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,273
it's<i> rio de caca</i> for
the both of them,

545
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,444
to which I say, "Hey, let's
involve Walt in this discussion,"

546
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,547
to which she says, "No,
let's cut Beneke a check

547
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,883
"so's he can pay off the IRS."

548
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,451
Again, not taking sides,

549
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,276
but she really was
trying to protect you.

550
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:38,281
A little feedback
here might be nice.

551
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,981
"Let's involve Walt
in this discussion."

552
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:45,383
Yeah, that's what I told her.

553
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,951
She said no.

554
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:49,269
And you didn't argue the point.

555
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,260
You didn't think to contact me.

556
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:55,043
You were a tad preoccupied

557
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,478
at the time, if you'll recall.

558
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:02,350
Okay. So, you
took it upon yourself

559
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:07,255
to give away
$622,000 of my money

560
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,558
to a man who had been
sleeping with my wife.

561
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:14,895
[SIGHS] She's my
client, same as you.

562
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,831
Does this arrangement
get a little tricky at times?

563
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,534
Absolutely.

564
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:22,152
But I try my best, you
know, ethically, in my duty...

565
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:24,388
Ethically?

566
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:27,358
I'm sorry. I must
be hearing things.

567
00:39:27,382 --> 00:39:32,380
Did you actually just use the
word "ethically" in a sentence?

568
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,982
You're not Clarence
Darrow, Saul.

569
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:37,351
You're a two-bit
bus-bench lawyer,

570
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,470
and you work for me.

571
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:41,839
Yeah, well, Clarence Darrow
never had a client like you

572
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:43,863
ask him for something...

573
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,810
Like this.

574
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:50,064
Okay? Yeah, I put my
ass on the line for you.

575
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,899
Huell, too. Huh?

576
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:53,467
He's got fingers like hotdogs.

577
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,436
He could've easily
busted this in two

578
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,589
and killed everyone in the
office, but do I complain?

579
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:01,359
No. Beg, borrow, or
steal, I'm your huckleberry.

580
00:40:01,383 --> 00:40:04,428
I go the extra mile.

581
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:08,104
Only you never told me that
kid would wind up in the hospital.

582
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,718
You know...

583
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,287
Take that thing and
get the hell out of here.

584
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,211
You and me, we're done.

585
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:32,390
What are you...

586
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:34,191
Come on. Hey.

587
00:40:34,215 --> 00:40:35,495
Hey.

588
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:44,424
We're done when
I say we're done.

589
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,677
SKYLER: [CHUCKLING]
Yes, you are...

590
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,449
[HOLLY SQUEAKS]

591
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,551
Hey.

592
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,853
I heard what happened to Ted.

593
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,525
He's not going to talk.

594
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:42,709
Yeah.

595
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:09,709
I forgive you.
