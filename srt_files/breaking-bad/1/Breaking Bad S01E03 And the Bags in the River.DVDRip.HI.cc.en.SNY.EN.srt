Everybody,

I need you all to
take your seats.

Settle down, please. Thank you.

538
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:52,062
I understand that
Mr. White is feeling

539
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:54,565
a little under the
weather this morning.

540
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:55,833
So you folks

541
00:42:55,857 --> 00:42:59,787
are going to have to be
making do with me today.

So, what do you think?

546

Ah, it's a cook site. Gotta be.

547

Nobody came way the
hell out here just to buy.

548
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,876
Fire there could have
started by accident.

549
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,079
I don't think that was
meant to destroy evidence.

Got a couple of Dooley tracks
headed away, towards the road.

So, what, they're in some
sort of camper-slash-lab?

They accidentally start a
fire and everybody FOs?

Yeah. Why not?

554
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:41,500
So why did that little
hair-gelled shit leave his car?

Ay-yi-yi.

556
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,651
Gomey, it's a
culture in decline.

557
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:49,837
It's a rich and vibrant culture.

558
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:52,506
It's a car that
jumps up and down.

You're wasting your time.

Give it up. If this
here's a trap car,

it's gonna take more than
your dumb white ass to find it.
