Aww...

710
00:41:24,332 --> 00:41:26,666
Nice. Yeah.

711
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:37,509
To clean cars and clean money.

712
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,747
Hear, hear.

713
00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:48,265
You see?

714
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:50,267
I told you we'd get it.

715
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,587
Did you? Mm-hm.

716
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:56,090
Wow. Ha, ha.

717
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:57,959
Seriously.

718
00:41:57,983 --> 00:42:00,861
It was really great work.

719
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,618
It's impressive.

720
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:05,388
Thank you.

721
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:09,487
And Saul finally
came through. Ahem.

722
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:13,490
Well, I mean, he
found the guy, right?

723
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,326
Well, yes, he found the guy,

724
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,095
but I told him what
to do and what to say.

725
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,886
You're right.
That's the hard part.

726
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:25,802
But, yes, Saul
was finally useful.

727
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:27,771
Ha, ha. Throw him a bone.

729
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:34,044
Mm. Oh, my God.

730
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:37,297
This is truly amazing.
Yes, well, it better be.

731
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,667
Three hundred
twenty dollars a bottle.

732
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,068
What?

733
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:44,288
"Cuvée Pol Roger
Sir Winston Churchill."

734
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,857
Apparently, it was his
favorite champagne,

735
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:49,293
so they just named it after him.

736
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,830
How did you pay for
it? What do you mean?

737
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:55,682
Ah. No. Cash, I paid cash.

738
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:59,469
No, I'm asking how
did you, Walter White,

739
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,006
an unemployed
schoolteacher, pay for it?

740
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,190
How do you explain it? Skyler.

741
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:06,911
No one saw me.

742
00:43:06,935 --> 00:43:08,662
Whoever sold it to you did.

743
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:09,930
And that's not the point.

744
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,700
The point is we're
broke, remember?

745
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:14,952
I'm waiting for your
unemployment check

746
00:43:14,976 --> 00:43:16,820
so I can pay the phone bill.

747
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,857
I asked for an extension
from the power company. Why?

748
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:21,925
Because on paper,
we have no money.

749
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:24,495
You are completely overreacting.

750
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,799
I'm not apologizing for wanting
to celebrate in some small way.

751
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:31,202
I'm not asking you
to apologize, Walt.

752
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:33,220
I'm asking you to be smart.

753
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:36,173
I bought one bottle
of champagne.

754
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:39,526
One single bottle, Skyler.

755
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,879
I paid cash. That's it.

756
00:43:41,903 --> 00:43:44,932
That's all it takes, okay? I
mean, look at Watergate.

757
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,034
One piece of duct tape on a door

758
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:50,037
brought down the president
of the United States.

759
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,006
What? I'm Nixon now? No.

760
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,975
What I'm saying is the
devil is in the details.

761
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:58,579
One little mistake,
one slipup in our story,

762
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,836
