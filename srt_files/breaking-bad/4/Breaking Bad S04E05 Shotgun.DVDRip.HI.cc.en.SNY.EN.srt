to something good, I
don't know, who knows,

542
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,622
he could've helped humanity
or something like that.

543
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:58,392
I mean, how many actual
geniuses are there in the world, right?

544
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:01,262
If he'd kind of taken his
life in a different direction,

545
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:02,729
who knows?

546
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,798
Hank...

547
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:10,404
not to tell you your business,
but I'm not sure I agree.

548
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,156
What do you mean? Well, I mean,

549
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,160
you showed me that
notebook, and from what I saw...

550
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:18,546
And this is just
my humble opinion.

551
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,449
From what I saw
on those papers...

552
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,406
Genius?

553
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,555
Not so much.

554
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:31,893
I mean, there was no reasoning,
no deductions in those pages.

555
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:35,729
So to my eye, all his brilliance

556
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:41,502
looks like nothing more
than just simple rote copying.

557
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:46,073
Probably of someone else's work.

558
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:50,015
Believe me, I have been
around enough students to know.

559
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:56,522
This genius of yours...

560
00:42:57,725 --> 00:43:01,127
maybe he's still out there.

562
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,251
Hank.

563
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,887
Oh, hey, babe.

564
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:18,756
Uh, Tim stopped by.

565
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,392
He... He brought over
some file boxes on that case.

566
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:23,994
Thought I'd take another peek.

567
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,084
That's great.

568
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,649
Sorry about the mess.

569
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:30,706
No, no, no. Don't be.

570
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:33,821
You want me to make some coffee?

571
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,125
Yeah.

572
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,097
Yeah, that'd be good.

573
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,573
Hm.

574
00:44:09,597 --> 00:44:11,014
You find something?

575
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:17,281
Oh, just this guy
I'm looking at.

576
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:20,684
You know, everything
he... He buys and eats

577
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:25,294
is organic, fair trade, vegan.

578
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,685
Since when do vegans
eat fried chicken?
