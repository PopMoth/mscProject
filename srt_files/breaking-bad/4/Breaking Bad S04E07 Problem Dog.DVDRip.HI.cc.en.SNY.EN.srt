656
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:09,813
I call their Houston office,

really reaching.

706
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:38,262
If your guy had
his meeting at KFC,

707
00:45:38,286 --> 00:45:40,164
you wouldn't immediately assume

708
00:45:40,188 --> 00:45:42,466
that he's sitting down
with Colonel Sanders.

709
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,634
You know, I... Ahem.

710
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,036
I couldn't agree more, guys.

712
00:45:47,862 --> 00:45:52,343
Gustavo Fring,
blue meth, you know.

713
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:56,268
The whole thing
is off-the-map nuts.

714
00:45:57,438 --> 00:46:00,306
I ought to be wearing
a tinfoil hat, you know?

715
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,921
Except...

716
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:08,943
I can't seem to wrap my
mind around this one little thing.

717
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:10,811
And that is,

718
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:13,235
what are Gustavo
Fring's fingerprints...

719
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,340
doing in Gale
Boetticher's apartment?
