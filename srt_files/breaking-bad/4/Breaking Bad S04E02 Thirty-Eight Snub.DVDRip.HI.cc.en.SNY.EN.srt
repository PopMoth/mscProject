his salt is gonna spot that, yeah.

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,262
Yes, it's a deal breaker.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,214
Well, if stealth is
what you're aspiring to,

9
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,119
you best go with
something more compact.

Ten in the mag,
one in the chamber.

it done with five,

19

on another six closing the deal.

better on the left side.

for the past 30-odd years.

55
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:07,580

57
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,402

urge to ask you,

58
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:16,239
are we strictly
talking defense here?

59
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:19,726

personal protection,

aside from a bucket of money,

64
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:33,106
you'd save yourself a
potential felony two-spot

65
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,975
for carrying a weapon
with a defaced serial number

66

if you buy it legally.

67
