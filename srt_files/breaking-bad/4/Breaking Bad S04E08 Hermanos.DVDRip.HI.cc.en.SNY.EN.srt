00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:27,286
that he didn't strike you as
being the boss-man type?

365
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,505

bigger guy out there, right?

was just speculation.

Chicken Man's fingerprints
at Boetticher's murder scene.

Fring killed Gale Boetticher?

Well, probably not.

These guys usually get a
dunce to pull the trigger, right?

374
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,279
His fingerprints being there
was enough for us to bring him in.

375
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:56,932
So you brought
him in to the police?

376
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,869
Right. He sits down to talk
with us. The problem is that...

377

him? What did he say?

finish my story here?

to kick our asses.

Okay? He's got an explanation
for the fingerprints, all right?

for Gale's murder.
