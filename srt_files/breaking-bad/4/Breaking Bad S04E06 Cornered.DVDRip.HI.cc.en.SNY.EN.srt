but he needed a car.

536
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:52,621
And I'm his father, and I should
be able to get what he wants.

537
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,272
It goes back.

538
00:44:58,296 --> 00:44:59,674
Tomorrow.

539
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:03,066
Skyler, it will crush him.

540
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:08,399
That car directly
contradicts our story.

541
00:45:08,423 --> 00:45:12,136
And if you're so invested
in protecting this family,

542
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,172
it means protecting the story.

543
00:45:15,196 --> 00:45:18,275
What do you think the
neighbors are going to say, Walt?

544
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,960
What about Hank and Marie?

545
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:24,065
How about the IRS? What
were you thinking, Walt?

546
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:29,058
I was thinking I wanted to
do something nice for my son.

547
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:39,418
Look.

548
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:44,923
I just worry that he'll
blame you for this.

549
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,791
Oh, he will.

550
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:53,493
Once again, he'll
blame his bitch mother

551
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:56,163
for taking away what his
loving father has given him,

552
00:45:56,187 --> 00:46:00,239
so thanks for that.

554
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:05,505
But you know what, Walt?

555
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,708
Someone has to
protect this family

556
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:11,166
from the man who
protects this family.

00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,792
