No.

537
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:54,708
Should I sit down?

538
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,292
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry, go ahead.

539
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:00,615
Okay, so, um...

540
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,885
Okay, so word has
come down that they...

541
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:08,889
They want me to go to Mexico.

542
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:12,176
There's some... Some
sort of war brewing

543
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,745
between Gus and the cartel.

544
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,413
"Word has come down"?

545
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,815
Yeah, the cartel has been...

546
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,917
Has been messing
with Gus' operation.

547
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,837
Like jacking trucks to,
like, send a message.

548
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:26,040
And, you know, yesterday,
that dude we brought to the lab.

549
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,659
I mean, they shot
him right in front of me.

550
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:30,962
I mean, just blew his head open.

551
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:34,253
I mean, some sniper nailed
him from like a mile away.

552
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,986
Anyway, uh, they've
been holding them off.

553
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,206
But between the
cartel taking potshots

554
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,508
and your brother-in-law
trying to throw a net

555
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:45,709
over the whole deal,

556
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,145
it's like what you call

557
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:49,663
a rock-and-a-hard-place
situation.

558
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:54,068
So, Gus is gonna cave.

559
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:58,172
So the cartel wants half
of Gus' entire operation,

560
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,508
and they want your formula.

561
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,043
And he's gonna give it to them.

562
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,328
Well, I... I gotta
give it to them.

563
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,164
I mean, I'm supposed
to go to Mexico and...

564
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:09,700
And teach a bunch
of cartel chemists

565
00:40:09,724 --> 00:40:12,954
how to cook a batch of blue.

566
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,789
You know, and Gus
doesn't trust you,

567
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:16,090
so I gotta go.

568
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:18,392
I mean, you're the chemist, man.

569
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,229
You know, not... Not me. I
mean, let's say I go down to...

570
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,450
You know, go over there...
Go... Go to the jungle or whatever,

571
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:29,070
you know, and they
got like actual chemists,

572
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:32,323
like cartel chemists
asking me chemistry stuff

573
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,493
that I don't know how to
answer because I'm not you.

574
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:37,361
And what if, like,
all the equipment

575
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:40,564
is in Mexican
instead of English?

576
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:42,967
You know? Oh!

577
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:44,552
I don't know. I don't know.

578
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:48,005
I mean, if... If I mess this up,

579
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,597
I am dead, you know? All of us.

580
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,830
Mr. White, look, I... I need...

581
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,682
I need your help.

582
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,835
Okay, maybe you could...

583
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:04,722
Maybe you could, like, coach
me or something, you know.

584
00:41:04,746 --> 00:41:08,075
Or you can, like,
give me some notes.

585
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,216
Mr. White?

586
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,169
So you saw Gus?

587
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,250
What? No.

588
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,385
You didn't see Gus.

589
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,071
No.

590
00:41:20,095 --> 00:41:23,407
Then who told you all of that?

591
00:41:23,431 --> 00:41:26,415
It was... It was passed
down, like I said.

592
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:31,014
"Passed down." By whom?

593
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:33,100
By, uh... By Mike and them.

594
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,635
I mean, they did. They...

595
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,839
So "they" doesn't include Gus.

596
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,523
You haven't been with Gus.

597
00:41:39,547 --> 00:41:42,726
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.

598
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,978
Why are you...?

599
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,263
You weren't at Gus'
house last night.

600
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:47,987
What?

601
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:52,591

Jesus.

605
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:07,468
You look me in the
eye and you tell me

606
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,925
that you weren't at
his house last night.

607
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:12,611
I, um...

608
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:18,479
Look, I didn't have
a chance, all right?

609
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,681
Okay? I knew you
would react this way.

610
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,651
I knew you would freak
out and wouldn't believe me.

611
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:27,187
That's... That's why
I didn't say anything.

612
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,691
Look, there was just this
one big pot of stew, okay?

613
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,361
He just made this one big
pot and we both ate from it.

614
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:36,163
What was I supposed to
do, huh? Poison myself?

615
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,965
Two hours and 18 minutes,

616
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,434
and you couldn't figure
out a way to give it to him?

617
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,837
He never left the room.
You lying little shit!

618
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:46,407
You had one thing
to do, one thing.

619
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:48,242
That is the only
thing, I might add,

620
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,143
that would save our lives.

621
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,297
And you were right there.
You were in his house.

622
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,587
And you didn't
have the guts to do it.

623
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,689
Two hours and 18 minutes?

624
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:06,060
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

625
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,480

at his house last night?

626

intentions, did you?

you've done for me?
