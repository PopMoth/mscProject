387

Well, it's not that simple.

388
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:12,213
Here's the thing: I never
had proper legal counsel.

389
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,817
So I was thinking I
should hire someone good

390
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,785
who can maybe
hammer out a better deal.

391
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,805
There will never be
a better deal, Ted.

392
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:23,307
The deal is you
pay your back taxes,

393
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:26,460
you pay your penalty,
and you don't go to prison.

394
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,698

priorities straight.

396
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:36,604
Well, my priority is
getting my business back.

397
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,456
Putting my employees
on the payroll,

398
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,275
so they can pay their mortgages.

399
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,695
Right. But I think your
employees would agree

400
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:48,082
you need to get your
financial situation in control

401
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,467
before you can help them.

402
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,937
Boy, the IRS got
you on commission?

403
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:55,640
I'm just saying that,
though I really understand

404
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,810
the temptation to
restart the business,

405
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,845
maybe the universe
is telling you

406
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:03,469
that you need to
pay what you owe.

407

411

you're hectoring me about this.

I'm telling you to drop this.

414
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,960
