Well, um, Ted,

183

the whole reason
we're in this mess

184
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:08,274
is because you had
me cooking your books.

185

So when did wrong suddenly
become a problem for you?

186
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:15,948
Now, hold on, that
was a one-time measure

187
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:18,618

to protect my employees

188
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:20,385

It might've been a mistake,

190
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,724
but that's no reason to
go out and make another.

191
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:28,594
No, Ted, this is the
big mistake, right here.

192
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:33,466
You owe the federal
government $617,000.

they will come after you

will come after me.

195
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:40,439
And if they audit my business,

196
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,409

and I paid for it

197
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:47,512

in untaxed gambling winnings,

198

201

Okay, fine, let's say
I take your advice.

205
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,851

206
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,353

207

the bank, Skyler.

Just because I pay
some stupid fine

doesn't make my

you correctly,
