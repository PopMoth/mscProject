change it to "opossum"?

363
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:24,843
What's up with that?

364
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:27,779
I mean, when I was coming
up, it was just "possum."

365
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:29,714
You know, "opossum"
makes it sound

366
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,416
like he's Irish or something.

367
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,153
I mean, why they gotta
go changing everything?

368
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,406
Whatever. It's just
big rats anyways.

369
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,877
Giant pink-tailed rats
with their pink rat faces.

370
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:46,703
Totally freaky, like alien rats.

371
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,020
Actually, it's not so
much that he got trapped,

372
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:56,357
but he was living there,
you know, under the house.

373
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,694
You could hear him going
from, like, room to room,

374
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,898
always scurrying around.

375
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,400
Sometimes I'd see
him outside at night

376
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,903
and it would just,
you know, freeze.

377
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:09,471
I mean, it's like you're

378
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,873
not looking right at it, right?

379
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,909
I mean, it thinks
it's fooling you.

380
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,244
That's what they do.

381
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,580
I mean, they play
dead or whatever.

382
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:21,416
It's just so lame.

383
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,455
Is there a discernible
point to this story?

384
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,524
A point that you'll
be arriving at

385
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:32,594
sometime in the near future?

386
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,762
It was just a total
bitch to get out.

387
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,431
You know, it took forever.

388
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:43,238
Guy came, set all these traps
and all and he finally got it.

389
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:48,810
But my aunt, you know,
she didn't believe it.

390
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:53,415
I mean, she kept insisting
she could still hear the thing.

391
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:56,418
I mean, you could not
tell her any different.

392
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:58,753
She started keeping
an old umbrella,

393
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,822
you know, by her chair.

394
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,992
Man, she would just bang
on the floor and yell at it.

395
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,528
Even gave it a name.

396
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:10,465
It was Scrabble.

397
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:11,766
Yeah, that was it.

398
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,935
You know, "Scrabble,
just knock it off."

399
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,659
Bang, bang, bang.

400
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:22,166
She got like that
toward the end.

401
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:30,152
Got obsessive about stuff.
Just got mad about stuff.

402
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:33,055
We didn't know what was up.

403
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,314
It wasn't like her
to be that way.

404
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:45,200
But it turned out
that the cancer

405
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:49,371
had spread to her
brain and that was why.

406
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:53,163
It, um, metastasized.

407
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,146
But it was good that
that was when we decided

408
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,183
to take her to the doctor,

409
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:04,319
because then we
knew what was up.

410
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:07,089
You know, got her
some treatment.

411
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:10,514
Meds, so she wasn't
stressing all the time.

412
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:18,400
It was a lot better after that.

413
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,958
You know, she was a lot happier.

414
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,735
Where the hell is he?

415
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:43,992
I've been to my
oncologist, Jesse,

416
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,749
just last week.

417
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,487
I'm still in remission.

418
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,501
I'm healthy.

419
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:58,328
Okay, so good. Great.

420
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:01,448
Well...

421
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:05,780
no end in sight.

422
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,104
That's great.

423
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,754
Well...

424
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,678
I missed it.

425
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:27,073
There was some perfect
moment and it passed me right by.

426
00:30:28,944 --> 00:30:33,825
I had to have
enough to leave them.

427
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:36,961
That was the whole point.

428
00:30:36,985 --> 00:30:39,897
I mean, none of this...

429
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:44,424
None of this makes any
sense if I didn't have enough.

430
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:50,542
But it had to be before
she found out. Skyler.

431
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:53,195
It had to be before that.

432
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:57,787
Perfect moment for what?

433
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,419
To drop dead?

434
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:04,577
What, you saying you wanna die?

435
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:11,784
I'm saying I've lived too long.

436
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:15,166
I mean,

437
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,438
you want them to actually
miss you, you know?

438
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:24,931
You want their
memories of you to be...

439
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:29,898
But she just won't...

440
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:33,101
She just won't understand.

441
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:37,972
I mean, no matter
how well I explain it,

442
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,175
these days, she just has this...

443
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,698
This...

444
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:47,782
I mean, I truly
believe there exists

445
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,184
some combination of words.

446
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:56,057
There must exist certain
words in a certain specific order

447
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,926
that would explain all of this,

448
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,629
but with her, I just...

449
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,665
I just can't ever
seem to find them.

450
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,035
Mr. White, how about
you just sit down?

451
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,071
You know, I was thinking
maybe before the fugue state,

452
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,574
but before the fugue state,
I didn't have enough money.

453
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,033
So no, not then.

454
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:30,091
And plus, my daughter
wasn't born yet.

455
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,893
It had to be after
Holly was born.

456
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,728
Mr. White...

457
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,487
Definitely before the surgery.

458
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,802
Oh, Christ.

459
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,105
That damn second cell phone.

460
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,662
I mean, how could I possibly...?

461
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,575
Ah, I know the moment.

462
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,549
It was the night Jane died.

463
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,940
Yeah, I...

464
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:20,391
I was at home and
we needed diapers,

465
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:25,296
and so I said I'd go,
but it was just an excuse.

466
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,331
Actually, that was the night

467
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:29,934
I brought you your
money, remember?

468
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:33,471
Yeah, I remember.

469
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:37,776
But afterward, I
stopped at a bar.

470
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,478
It was odd. I never do that,

471
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:42,814
go to a bar alone.

472
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:46,472
I just walked in, sat down.

473
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,675
I never told you.

474
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,832
That you went to a bar?

475
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,501
No, I...

476
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:05,854
I sit down and this
man, this stranger,

477
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,323
he engages me in conversation.

478
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,396
He's a complete stranger.

479
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,612
But he turns out to be

480
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:19,283
Jane's father, Donald Margolis.

481
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,185
What are you talking about?

482
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:23,204
Of course, I didn't
know it at the time.

483
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:27,175
I mean, he was just
some guy in a bar.

484
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,844
I didn't put it together
until after the crash

485
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,545
when he was all over the news.

486
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,715
Jane's dad.

487
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,518
I mean, think of the odds.

488
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,421
Once I tried to calculate them,

489
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,556
but they're astronomical.

490
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,477
I mean, think of the odds
of me going in, sitting down,

491
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:50,620
that night in that
bar next to that man.

492
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,292
What did you talk about?

493
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,174
Oh...

494
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,498
Water on Mars.

495
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,570
Family.

496
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,675
What about family?

497
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,376
I told him that I had a daughter

498
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,312
and he told me he had one too.

499
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:23,414
Then he said,

500
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:25,772
"Never give up on family."

501
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:30,410
And I didn't.

502
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,531
I took his advice.

503
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:53,094
The universe is
random. It's not inevitable.

504
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:56,364
It's simple chaos.

505
00:35:56,388 --> 00:36:01,268
It's subatomic particles in
endless aimless collision.

506
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,222
That's what science teaches us.

507
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,946
But what is this saying?

508
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,028
What is it telling us when,

509
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:16,100
on the very night that
this man's daughter dies,

510
00:36:16,124 --> 00:36:20,727
it's me who's having
a drink with him?

511
00:36:23,465 --> 00:36:26,361
I mean, how can that be random?

512
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:29,379
Hey, come on. Hey, sit down.

513
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:32,571
No, no. No, it's...

514
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:38,577
No. No.

515
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:47,153
No, that was the moment.

516
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,489
That night.

517
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:56,295
I should never have left home.

518
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:01,567
Never gone to your house.

519
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:09,408
Maybe things would have...

520
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:17,516
Oh, thought I was...

521
00:37:19,453 --> 00:37:23,322
I was at home watching TV.

522
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:27,071
It was some...

523
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:31,798
Some nature program
about elephants.

524
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:37,203
And Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

525
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:43,009
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

526
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:49,015
She was singing a lullaby.

527
00:37:57,425 --> 00:38:02,740
If I had just lived right
up to that moment,

528
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:05,531
and not one second more...

That's why he likes it.
