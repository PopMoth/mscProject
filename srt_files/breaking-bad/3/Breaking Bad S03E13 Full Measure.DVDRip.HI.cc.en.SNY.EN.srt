That's a big one.

357
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:29,861
And that's something
I provide for you.

358
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,863
So if I give up Pinkman,

359
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,631
well, then you're
gonna be asking,

360
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:35,567
"Old Saul gives
them up pretty easy.

361

from giving me up?"

362
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:39,979

where's the trust?

363
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,882
I trust the hole in the
desert I'd leave you in.

364
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,898
Yeah, that's an argument.

365
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,067

366
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:56,388

till your legs don't work.

him. You know it's the right thing.

374
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,135

to the parents.

about the cooking process.

424

I try to be as
vague as possible,

425

Victor watching me,

You know, maybe that
the only thing saving me

428
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:52,290
is Gale's fastidiousness.

429
00:33:52,314 --> 00:33:57,217
And once he feels confident
that he knows my entire method...

430
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,674

Gus can't afford to.

447

So if I'm the only
chemist that he's got,

448
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,927

leverage keeps me alive.
