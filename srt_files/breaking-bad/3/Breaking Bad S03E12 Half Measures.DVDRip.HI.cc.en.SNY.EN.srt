talking about this.

175
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,621
I know a woman who buys from
these two once or twice a week.

176
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,206
She brings them hamburgers.

177
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,459
They sit in their
car and get hungry,

178
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,810
so she brings them food,

179
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:00,112
and they knock a
few bucks off her price.

180
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,714

system right there.

trusting to do this?

183
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:11,507
Know what? That meth-head
stood up to your brother-in-law.

184
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:15,178
He questioned her for five
hours. She didn't give it up.

185
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,762
You know how it is you know it?

186
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:19,048

in prison right now.

187
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,717
Well, I know I would
be in prison after this.

188
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,054
Prison or worse. And
I'd be right alongside you.

189

No, Jesse, you
cannot be serious.

190
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,360
This is a ridiculous idea.

191

saying it's not gonna work?

192

How about back
when it was your plan?

193
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,820
Back when we were
gonna use it on Tuco.

194

something and he keels over.

Yo. It was a good plan
back when it was Tuco,

203

go after these guys

211
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:29,218

found out about them.

212

213

could it have been

for you to track them
down on their turf

216
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,963
and kill them months ago?

217
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:45,301
Because back then, you
were too busy getting high,

218
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,103
feeling sorry.

219
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:54,243
Now, murder is not part
of your 12-step program.

If you don't see
what it accomplishes,

225
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:20,169

can explain it to you.
