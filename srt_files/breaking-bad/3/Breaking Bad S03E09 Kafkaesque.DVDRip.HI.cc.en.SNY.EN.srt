All right, so when do we
get him walking again?

225
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:11,543
Marie, it's important that
we manage our expectations.

226
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,280
We're talking about
months of very hard work.

And even then, the
odds, they're not great.

But you can't know for sure.

236
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,233
No, that's not gonna do it.

237
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:36,636
I've looked into this.

238
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,454
And the sooner
physical therapy begins,

239
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,990
the better his chances are.

240
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:44,292
He needs daily
sessions. Isn't that right?

241
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,661
Well... Actually,

242
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:49,065
your plan's treatment program
covers four sessions a week.

243
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,335
Actually, she asked the doctor.

244
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:58,507
Um, plan-wise, four treatments
a week is fairly typical.

245
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,777
And the therapists in your
network are mostly fine.

246
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:05,414
Mostly fine. Okay, well,
there's a ringing endorsement.

247
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,935
Look, if Hank had
more physical therapy

248
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,604
with better therapists,

249
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:15,396
wouldn't it be more
likely he would walk?

250
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:20,546
It's very hard to say, Marie.

251
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,000
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

252
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,503
Is it absolutely optimal?

253
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,573

frustration. Really, I do.

257
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:40,766
But my best advice
is stay in the network.

258
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,068
Don't go out of pocket.

259
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:44,420

is just the beginning.

occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

262
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,263
It could run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

263
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,864
So what?

264
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,533
We're just supposed to
compromise on his care?

384

Ted, and thank you again.

best time for a visit, so...

I know you need to
be with your family,

00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,070
but I haven't heard
from you in days

542
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,139
and I left messages...
I'm so sorry.

543
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,126
You gave me all that time
off and I really should've...

544
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:25,430
That's not my point. I
care about you. That's all.

545
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:28,249
Ted, I... It's just this
whole thing with Hank

546
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:32,704
has been one nonstop
horror show, you know, so...

547
00:33:32,728 --> 00:33:37,408
Well, I just want you to
know that I'm here for you.

548
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,177
Thank you.

do need you to...

really wanna do this now?

Are you gonna make
me do this right now?

more than enough.
Walt earned it.

00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,363
Skyler. SKYLER: I think Marie

651
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:06,730
should know the truth.

652
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:10,534
Skyler, I really don't
think this is a good idea.

653
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:13,476
I think that... He
earned it gambling.

654
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:20,895
Walt and I, uh...

655
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,452
we've had our problems
lately. You know that.

656
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:31,305
And, uh, what it all
came down to really

657
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:34,841
was money.

658
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,994
Pure and simple.

659
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,785
When Walt was
diagnosed, it, um...

660
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:44,635
it changed him.

661
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:48,005
And looking back, I don't
think I ever really understood

662
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,758
what it was that he
was going through.

663
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,661
It was more than facing death.

664
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:56,853
It was knowing that he
was gonna leave behind...

665
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,523
nothing.

666
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,871
And so that's
how this all started.

667
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,707
For better or worse,

668
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,910
he wanted to provide.

669
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:13,681
And so he paid his medical bills

670
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:17,552
the only way he knew how.

671
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:20,020
I thought that
Elliot and Gretchen

672
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,556
paid for your treatment.

673
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,691
Yeah, I thought so too.

674
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:27,344
The truth is he never took
their money. Not a dime.

675
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:32,649
He was too proud to take
what he considered to be charity.

676
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:33,839
Isn't that right?

677
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:42,281
So he put his mind to it and...

678
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:48,599
Well, you know how Walt is.

679
00:41:48,623 --> 00:41:50,768
He's a problem-solver.

680
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:55,907
And he read books and he
did a whole bunch of research,

681
00:41:55,931 --> 00:42:00,878
and he came up with this system.

682
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:03,447

you know, all the details,

687
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,110
but he was convinced

688
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:20,848
that if he put enough
money into it, he'd have a...

689
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,883

So... Um, yeah.

693
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:33,978
So he, every spare minute,

694
00:42:34,002 --> 00:42:36,747
Walt was at some
card table somewhere.

695
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:38,749
And at first he
went to the casinos,

696
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:40,284

that the casinos report

00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,476
You remember all those long
walks that Walt used to take,

705
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,786
all that time he used to
spend away from home?

706
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,103
I guess for a
couple months there,

707
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:19,428
you were sort of leading
a double life, weren't you?

708
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,013
Oh, my God.

709
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:29,533
Oh, my God, y-your...
Your fugue state.

710
00:43:29,557 --> 00:43:32,820
Was that some sort
of cover? No, no.

711
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:35,005
He did not fake that, Marie.

712
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,629
The night that
Walt disappeared...

713
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:45,382
he lost $14,000.

[SIGHS]

715
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:50,387
It was his pension
fund, our savings,

716
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:56,560
basically every last dime
we had to our name, gone.

717
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:59,263
He couldn't live with it.

718
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:01,365
He was suicidal.

719
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,600
But you have to understand

720
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:06,403
that as soon as he
got out of the hospital,

721
00:44:06,427 --> 00:44:08,205
he went right back to gambling.

722
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:12,442
I mean, that's how
deep this went.

723
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:17,336
How could you do
that to her, Walt?

724
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:21,657
Anyway, this system of his?

725
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,844
He finally got it to work.

726
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,528
So all this is to say
we have the money.

727
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:34,720
No more gambling.

728
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,390
But we have the money.

729
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:45,008
How much money?

730
00:44:45,032 --> 00:44:46,181
Walt?

731
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:51,649
Uh...

732
00:44:51,673 --> 00:44:53,506
Well...

733
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:00,607
it's into seven figures.

734
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,726
Oh.

What can I say?

737
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:10,873
I did very well.

738
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:14,605
Marie,

739
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,063
you will take our money.

740
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,646
Use it to take care of Hank.

741
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:27,123
Please. Marie, let us help.

742
00:45:29,043 --> 00:45:32,739
Does Walt, Jr. know
about this? Absolutely not.

743
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,841
And I need to keep it that way.

744
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,978
And Hank, okay? Hank's got
enough on his mind right now.

745
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:39,980
Can we please keep
this between us?

746
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:41,615
Yeah. Yeah, I...

747
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,701
Yeah, I just... I need to...

748
00:45:44,725 --> 00:45:47,793
Yeah, okay. We'll
talk about it later.

749
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:52,526
How did you come up with that?

750
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,568
I mean, where
did you possibly...?

751
00:45:57,238 --> 00:45:59,639
I learned from the best.

752
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,858
Somehow,

753
00:46:07,882 --> 00:46:12,846
something tells me that
Hank is here because of you.

754
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:17,456
And I'm not forgetting that.
