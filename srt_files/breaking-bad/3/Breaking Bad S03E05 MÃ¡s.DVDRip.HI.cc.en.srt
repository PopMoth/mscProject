00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,984
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

529
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:54,121
I hate to break
it to you, Jesse,

530
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:57,758
but our mutual associate

531
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:01,995
was only using you to get to me.

532
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,880
What are you talking about?

533
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:08,452
See, he needs
someone with expertise,

534
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:11,739
someone who knows
what he's doing.

535
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,842
In other words, he needs me.

536
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,578
You're telling me
you're cooking again?

537
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:21,187
Yeah. Let's see,
how should I put this?

538
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,404
I'm in.

539
00:42:25,994 --> 00:42:27,376
You're out.

540
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,210
Whoa, whoa, Walt, hold on there.

541
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:37,481
What was the
offer, if I may ask?

542
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:42,602
It's 3 million for three
months of my time.

543
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:46,223
SAUL: You're gonna need
that money laundered. Of course.

544
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:47,658
What was our deal before?

545
00:42:47,682 --> 00:42:50,027
Seventeen percent.
That's a shade high.

546
00:42:50,051 --> 00:42:53,097
Let's settle on an even 15.
That's a nice round number.

547
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:54,297
Five percent.

548
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,100
Fourteen's fair. Five.

549
00:42:56,124 --> 00:42:57,300
Thirteen. Five.

550
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,570
Twelve. For old
times' sake. Five.

551
00:43:00,594 --> 00:43:03,273
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

552
00:43:03,297 --> 00:43:06,677
Ten even, but I can't go any
lower and still respect myself.

553
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:08,112
Five.

554
00:43:08,136 --> 00:43:12,182
What in the hell just happened?
You're my lawyer, not his.

555
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:15,819
That's the way of the world,
kid. Go with the winner.

556
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,288
You think this will
stop me from cooking?

557
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:19,990
Cook whatever you like.

558
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:24,128
As long as it's that ridiculous
Chili P or some other dreck,

559
00:43:24,152 --> 00:43:27,497
but don't even think
about using my formula.

560
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,622
Just try and stop me, bitch.

Yes? Hi there, Mrs. Ortega?

00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:26,089
Yes. Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.

I'm with the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,478
We're interested in an RV

568
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:33,530
that's registered to
your name and address.

569
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:35,332
Do you have an RV?

570
00:44:35,356 --> 00:44:36,667
I did.

571
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:38,702
It was stolen months ago.

572
00:44:38,726 --> 00:44:41,605
Stolen, huh? Yeah.

573
00:44:41,629 --> 00:44:45,642
Well, then I'm curious as to
why the theft was never reported.

574
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:49,363
I'm not seeing any records of
it with the police or the DMV.

575
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:51,765
I just didn't get around to it.

576
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,801
May I ask why?

577
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,787
I mean, it's a great way
to get the family together

for an affordable vacation.

579
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,925
It must've been a blow
when it went missing.

580
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,349
It was.

581
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,920
Do you have any ideas at
all who might've taken it?

582
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,887
I didn't want him arrested.

583
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:17,457
He ran with a bad crowd, but
he was never a bad person.

584
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,743
I thought he could
turn his life around.

585
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:22,029
Who are we talking
about, Mrs. Ortega?

586
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,932
My son.

I'd really like to
speak with him.

588
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:32,477
He's passed away. He
was shot two months ago.
