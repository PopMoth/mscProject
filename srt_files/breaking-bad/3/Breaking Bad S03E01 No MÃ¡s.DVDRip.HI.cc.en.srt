three big bumps,

523
00:42:57,859 --> 00:42:59,904
and that's how you know.

524
00:42:59,928 --> 00:43:01,995
We are officially in Texas!

525
00:43:09,037 --> 00:43:11,432
This time I got a
job waiting for me.

526
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:15,769
I got a cousin who's
got a body shop.

527
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,804
Yo, that's for me, homes.

528
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:22,459
They call me "Olive Oil"
because I paint them slick.

529
00:43:22,483 --> 00:43:28,087
I do pearlescent,
color-shift, you name it.

530
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,052
I painted cars for some of

531
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,377
the biggest gangsters
in Michoacán.

532
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,048
Wow, those are beautiful boots.

533
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:43,797
Not much good
for working, but...

534
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,789
Hey, what's on the
toes there? Little silver...

going on in there?
