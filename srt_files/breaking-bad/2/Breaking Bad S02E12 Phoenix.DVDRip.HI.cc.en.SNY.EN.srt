00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,600
but, hey, God bless
them, they found it.

705
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:09,066
Oh, well, actually,

706
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:14,005
they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen

707
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:18,426
and process that into providing
fuel for man's space flights.

708
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:22,996
Ostensibly, turning Mars
into a giant gas station.

709
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,699
So it's a...

710
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:29,804
Yeah. We live in
an amazing time.

00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:34,797
To water on Mars.
To water on Mars.

712
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:40,231
So, what did you
have? Girl or boy?

713
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:42,299
Oh.

714
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,668
Little girl. That's nice.

715
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,069
Thanks. Congratulations.

716
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:47,304
Thank you.

717
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:50,040
I have a daughter. Yeah?

718
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:51,375
How old?

719
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:53,461
Heh. Old enough to know better.

720
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:55,530
Twenty-seven next month.

721
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:57,487
Oh, wow.

722
00:40:58,657 --> 00:41:01,925
You have other
kids? Just the one.

723
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:08,175
I've got a 16-year-old
boy. Well, he's almost 16.

724
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:13,264
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?

725
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:14,732
But he helps out, though.

726
00:41:14,756 --> 00:41:17,801
He's even changing
some diapers now, so...

727
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:21,689
It's more than I managed
to do when I was his age.

728
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:25,359
Kids today grow
up faster, I think.

729
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:28,284
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

730
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:32,633
So any advice?

731
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,903
Having a daughter. Any advice?

732
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,938
Oh. No, not really.

733
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,707
Just love them.

734
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,542
Just... Yeah.

735
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:45,101
I mean, they... They
are who they are.

736
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,831
Yeah.

00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:54,622

739
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:59,948
This nephew who is...
I mean, he's an adult.

740
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,764
But you can't infantilize them,

741
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:07,034
you can't live
their life for them.

742
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:10,805
But still, I mean,
there is that frustration.

743
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:12,507
You know, that...

744
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,977
God, that frustration that
goes along with, you know:

745
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:17,277
"Yes, as a matter of fact,

746
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,236
I do know what is
best for you, so listen."

747
00:42:22,356 --> 00:42:24,423
But of course, they don't.

748
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,890
I mean, what do you do
with someone like that?

749
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,314
Family?

750
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,399
Yeah. Family.

751
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:41,134
You can't give up
on them. Never.
