522
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,788
Two cell phones, after all.

523
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,602
What?

524
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,754
Right before your surgery,

525
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,521
I asked if you had
packed your cell phone,

526
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:28,347
and you said, "Which one?"

527
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:30,978
When?

528
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,747
Skyler, I was medicated.

529
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,116

said the world was flat.

You know what I think?

531
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:42,589

told the truth.

Asked and answered, right?

534
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,798
Then it got me thinking again,

535
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:54,601
about all the strange behavior.

536
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,271

was the disappearance.

worry, calling hospitals,

00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,709
I had to find a way.

00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:19,060

lie about such a thing?

00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,154
That's what I was thinking.
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

549
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,040
With whom? Who am
I having an affair with?

550
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,626
Well, my guess was
Gretchen Schwartz.

551
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,130
Something was going on
between you. I just knew.

552
00:40:40,154 --> 00:40:41,549
Jesus. Skyler.

553
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,918

on, if that's what it takes.

554
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,920
I am not having an
affair with Gretchen.

555
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:49,161
Oh, I know. I know you're
not. Because I asked her.

556
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:55,413
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

557
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:57,398
She was ducking
my calls for weeks.

558
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:59,800
So I finally left a message:

559
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,158
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

560
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:06,457
I thought that'd get
her attention and it did.

561
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:10,232
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

562
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,086
The money for your treatment,

563
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,342
Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

564
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:22,757

You refused every
offer they made you.

566

But that didn't make sense,

567
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:29,529
because I checked with
Delcavoli and the hospital,

568
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:33,067
