00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,669
Let me get down to brass tacks.

358
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,503
I'm gonna get you
a second phone call.

359
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,739
Okay, you're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy

360
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:23,341
or your parish priest or
your Boy Scout leader,

361
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,645
and they're gonna deliver
me a check for $4650.

362
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:29,048
I'm gonna write that down on
the back of my business card.

363
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:32,400
Okay. Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

364
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,454
And I need that in a cashier's
check or a money order,

365
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:36,655
doesn't matter.

366
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:39,341
Actually, uh, I want
it in a money order.

367
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,344
And, uh, make it out to "Ice
Station Zebra Associates."

368
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:45,113
That's my loan-out.
It's, uh, totally legit.

369
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,199
It's done just for tax purposes.

00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,102

discuss Visa or MasterCard,

371

but definitely not
American Express,

372
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:54,006
so don't even ask. All right?

373
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,212

Didn't I take these already?

383
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,253
Okay. Look, it's on your head.

384
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,222
You're not supposed to
double up on vitamin A.

385
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:29,113

Okay, who's next?

00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,330

They suck ass.

an epileptic whorehouse.

Is that like the one
your mom works at?

397

399
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:05,582

Look, you remember Emilio?

409
00:23:41,537 --> 00:23:44,883
Okay, this dude got
Emilio off, like, twice. Okay?

410
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:47,819
Both times, they had
him dead to rights, yo.

you don't want
a criminal lawyer.

You want a "criminal" lawyer.

417
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:04,369
Look, we're in good
shape, Mr. White.

418
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:06,738

And it's only his
first dealing rap,

423
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,200
so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

up litter in an orange jump suit.

them seeing my face.
