terrible had happened.

707
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,920
And then your cell phone rang.

708
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,123
And I saw you check the
number, and then you got up

709
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:20,032
and just disappeared.

710
00:45:21,035 --> 00:45:23,246
Hm. Yeah.

711
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,749
And when Hank checked
your phone records,

712
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:29,219
there was no call.

713
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:34,291
No call on the
phone I know about.

714
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:37,544
Wow.

715
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,435
That is odd.

716
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,484
I mean, I don't
remember any of that,

717
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,386
but one thing I am sure of

718
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,628
is that I don't have
a second cell phone.

719
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:54,350
Okay.

720
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,443
