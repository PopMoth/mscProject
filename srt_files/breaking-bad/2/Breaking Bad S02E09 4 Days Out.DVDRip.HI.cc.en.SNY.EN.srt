532
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,378

533
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:17,732

straight in my head anymore.

535
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:25,362

can come or not.

00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,666

537
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,371
Jesse. Jesse.

538
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,387
Your body

539
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:43,280
is running dangerously
low on electrolytes.

540
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,830
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

541
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:51,666
And when they're gone,

542
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,437
your brain ceases to
communicate with your muscles.

543
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:58,573
Your lungs stop breathing,

544
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,693
your heart stops pumping.

545
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:05,763
You go marching out there

546
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:10,001
and within an hour,
you will be dead.

547
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,836

crybaby crap right now

549
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:16,374

something scientific.

scientific, right.

556
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:37,228

some of these chemicals

557
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:39,781

Some rocket fuel?

558

And we can just
send up a signal flare.

Or you make some kind
of robot to get us help,

560

561

some stuff off of the RV

564
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,501

completely different?

Well, trust me, it is a battery.

Huh? Well, think about it.

594
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:35,313
A battery is a galvanic cell.

595
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:38,282
It's no more than an
anode and a cathode,

596
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:40,685
separated by an
electrolyte, right?

597
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:43,488
Right. Yeah, well, anyway.

598
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:47,257
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide

599
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:49,744
and graphite from
your brake pads.

600
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,879
This is the cathode.

601
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,081
This is the positive terminal.

602
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,684
This is where the...
The supply of current

603
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,620

604
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:01,456
Then... Here, I'll show you.

605
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,175
On the opposite
side is our anode.

00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,428
This.

607
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,180
It's zinc.

608
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,783
It's what we find in
our... Find in our coins

is the electrolyte?

611
00:38:17,145 --> 00:38:18,489
Yeah.

612
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:22,126
Well, no, the potassium
hydroxide is the electrolyte.

613
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,997
But, yes, that's what I'm
soaking the sponges in.

00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,518
will this supply enough current?

628
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,504

Oh, my God. DELCAVOLI:
I wanna clarify.

668
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:43,787
There are some misconceptions

669
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,673
about what remission
actually signifies.

670
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:48,125
It does not mean that
the patient is cured.

671
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,427
To classify someone
as in remission,

672
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:53,047
we only need to determine
that the tumor hasn't grown.

673

That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,634
DELCAVOLI: Technically speaking,

675
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,887
a tumor can remain the
exact same size it was before

676
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,490

still be in remission.

Are you sure about
that? I mean, I...

710
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,224
Because the other day,

711
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:48,250
I was coughing up some blood.

712
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,799
What? You probably have a tear

713
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,400
in your esophagus
from the coughing,

714
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,585
and that can be very serious.

715
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,370
You could rupture
and bleed to death.

716
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,372
This is something we're
gonna have to deal with

717
00:44:58,396 --> 00:44:59,874
before you leave here today.

718
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:01,742
Wait a minute. Walt,
when did this happen?

719
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:03,010
Why didn't you tell me?

720
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,779
I'm sorry, I just... No
more secrets, Walt.

721
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:09,455
With something like this, you
have to call me immediately.

722
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,021
Now, with these results, we're
not completely out of the woods.

723
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:16,223
But now at least we
have some options,

724
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:20,227
the most important
of which is time.

725
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:22,596
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

726
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,798
But for now, I'd say

727
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,902
that you folks have
earned some celebrating.
